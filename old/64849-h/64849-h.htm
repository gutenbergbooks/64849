<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The enormous advance which has been recently made in
our astronomical knowledge, and in our power of investigating
the various bodies which people space, is to a very great
extent due to the introduction of methods of work and ideas
from other branches of science.</p>

<p>Much of the recent progress has been, we may indeed
say, entirely dependent upon the introduction of the methods
of inquiry to which I refer. While this is generally recognised,
it is often forgotten that a knowledge of even elementary
astronomy may be of very great assistance to students of
other branches of science; in other words, that astronomy
is well able to pay her debt. Amongst those branches
is obviously that which deals with man's first attempts to
grasp the meaning and phenomena of the universe in which
he found himself before any scientific methods were available
to him; before he had any idea of the origins or the conditionings
of the things around him.</p>

<p>In the present volume I propose to give an account
of some attempts I have been making in my leisure moments
during the past three years to see whether any ideas could
be obtained as to the early astronomical views of the Egyptians,
from a study of their temples and the mythology connected
with the various cults.</p>

<p>How I came to take up this inquiry may be gathered
from the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>It chanced that in March, 1890, during a brief holiday,
I went to the Levant. I went with a good friend, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii"> viii</span>
one day when we were visiting the ruins of the Parthenon,
and again when we found ourselves at the temple at Eleusis,
lent me his pocket-compass. The curious direction in which
the Parthenon was built, and the many changes of direction
in the foundations at Eleusis revealed by the French excavations,
were so very striking and suggestive that I thought
it worth while to note the bearings so as to see whether
there was any possible astronomical origin for the direction
of the temple and the various changes in direction to which
I have referred. What I had in my mind was the familiar
statement that in England the eastern windows of churches
face generally&mdash;if they are properly constructed&mdash;to the
place of sun-rising on the festival of the patron saint; this
is why, for instance, the churches of St. John the Baptist
face very nearly north-east. This direction towards the sun-rising
is the origin of the general use of the term <i>orientation</i>,
which is applied just as frequently to other buildings the
direction of which is towards the west or north or south.
Now, if this should chance to be merely a survival from
ancient times, it became of importance to find out the
celestial bodies to which the ancient temples were directed.</p>

<p>When I came home I endeavoured to ascertain whether
this subject had been worked out: I am afraid I was a
nuisance to many of my archæological friends, and I made
as much inquiry as I could by looking into books. I found,
both from my friends and from the books, that this question
had not been discussed in relation to ancient temples, scarcely
even with regard to churches outside England or Germany.</p>

<p>It struck me that, since nothing was known, an inquiry
into the subject&mdash;provided an inquiry was possible for a stay-at-home&mdash;might
help the matter forward to a certain extent.
So, as it was well known that the temples in Egypt had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix"> ix</span>
most carefully examined and oriented both by the French in
1798 and by the Prussians in 1844, I determined to see
whether it was possible to get any information on the general
question from them, as it was extremely likely that such
temples as that at Eleusis were more or less connected with
Egyptian ideas. I soon found that, although neither the
French nor the Germans apparently paid any heed to the
possible astronomical ideas of the temple-builders, there
was little doubt that astronomical considerations had a great
deal to do with the direction towards which these temples
faced. In a series of lectures given at the School of Mines
in November, 1890, I took the opportunity of pointing out that
in this way archæologists and others might ultimately be enabled
to arrive at dates in regard to the foundation of temples,
and possibly to advance knowledge in several other directions.</p>

<p>After my lectures were over, I received a very kind letter
from one of my audience, pointing out to me that a friend had
informed him that Professor Nissen, in Germany, had published
some papers on the orientation of ancient temples. I at once
ordered them. Before I received them I went to Egypt to
make some inquiries on the spot with reference to certain
points which it was necessary to investigate, for the reason
that when the orientations were observed and recorded, it
was not known what use would be made of them, and certain
data required for my special inquiry were wanting. In Cairo
also I worried my archæological friends. I was told that
the question had not been discussed; that, so far as they
knew, the idea was new; and I also gathered a suspicion that
they did not think much of it. However, one of them,
Brugsch Bey, took much interest in the matter, and was good
enough to look up some of the old inscriptions, and one day
he told me he had found a very interesting one concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x"> x</span>
the foundation of the temple at Edfû. From this inscription
it was clear that the idea was not new; it was possibly
six thousand years old. Afterwards I went up the river, and
made some observations which carried conviction with them
and strengthened the idea in my mind that for the orientation
not only of Edfû, but of all the larger temples which I
examined, there was an astronomical basis. I returned to
England at the beginning of March, 1891, and within a few
days of landing received Professor Nissen's papers.</p>

<p>I have thought it right to give this personal narrative,
because, while it indicates the relation of my work to Professor
Nissen's, it enables me to make the acknowledgment that the
credit of having first made the suggestion belongs, so far as
I know, solely to him.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The determination of the stars to which some of the
Egyptian temples, sacred to a known divinity, were directed,
opened a way, as I anticipated, to a study of the astronomical
basis of parts of the mythology. This inquiry I have carried
on to a certain extent, but it requires an Egyptologist to
face it, and this I have no pretensions to be. It soon
became obvious, even to an outsider like myself, that the
mythology was intensely astronomical, and crystallised early
ideas suggested by actual observations of the sun, moon, and
stars. Next, there were apparently two mythologies, representing
two schools of astronomical thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi"> xi</span></p>

<p>Finally, to endeavour to obtain a complete picture, it
became necessary to bring together the information to be
obtained from all these and other sources, including the old
Egyptian calendars, and to compare the early Babylonian
results with those which are to be gathered from the Egyptian
myths and temple-orientations.</p>

<p>It will, I think, be clear to anyone who reads this volume
that its limits and the present state of our knowledge have
only allowed me really to make a few suggestions. I have
not even attempted to exhaust any one of the small number
of subjects which I have brought forward; but if I have
succeeded so far as I have gone, it will be abundantly evident
that, if these inquiries are worth continuing, a very considerable
amount of work has to be done.</p>

<p>Of this future work, the most important, undoubtedly, is
a re-survey of the temple sites, with modern instruments and
methods. Next, astronomers must produce tables of the rising
and setting conditions of the stars for periods far beyond
those which have already been considered. The German
Astronomical Society has published a table of the places of
a great many stars up to 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, but to carry on this
investigation we must certainly go back to 7000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and
include southern stars. While the astronomer is doing this,
the Egyptologist, on his part, must look through the inscriptions
with reference to the suggestions which lie on the surface of
the inquiry. The astronomical and associated mythological
data want bringing together. One part of that work will
consist in arranging tables of synonyms like those to which
I presently refer in the case of the goddesses. My own
impression is that this work will not really be so laborious
as the statement of it might seem to imply. I have attempted
to go over the ground during the last two years as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii"> xii</span>
my ignorance would allow me, and I have arrived at the
impression that the number both of gods and goddesses will
be found to be extremely small; that the apparent wealth
of the mythology depends upon the totemism of the inhabitants
in the Nile valley&mdash;by which I mean that each district had
its own special animal as the emblem of the tribe dwelling
in it, and that every mythological personage had to be
connected in some way with these local cults. After this
work is done, it will be possible to begin to answer some
of the questions which I have only ventured to raise.</p>

<p>I am glad to take this opportunity of expressing my
obligations to the authorities in Egypt for the very great
help they gave towards the furthering of the inquiries which
were set on foot there. Many of my own local observations
would, in all probability, never have been made if my friend
Major A. Davis, of Syracuse (New York) had not invited
me to join him in a cruise up the river in the s.s. <i>Mohamet
Aly</i> and practically given me full command of her movements.
My best thanks are due to him not only for his hospitality,
but for sympathetic aid in my inquiries.</p>

<p>Dr. Wallis Budge and Captain Lyons, R.E., have rendered
continual help while this book has been in progress, and I
cannot sufficiently thank them; to the first-named I am
especially indebted for looking over the proof sheets. I am
also under obligations to Professors Maspero, Krall, and Max
Müller for information on certain points, and to Professors
Sayce and Jensen for many valuable suggestions in the
chapters dealing with Babylonian astronomy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE WORSHIP OF THE SUN AND THE DAWN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> we inquire among which early peoples we are
likely to find the first cultivation of astronomy,
whatever the form it may have taken, we learn that it is
generally agreed by archæologists that the first civilisations
which have so far been traced were those in the Nile Valley
and in the adjacent countries in Western Asia.</p>

<p>The information which we possess concerning these
countries has been obtained from the remains of their cities,
of their temples&mdash;even, in the case of Babylonia, of their
observatories and of the records of their observations. Of
history on papyrus we have relatively little.</p>

<p>Not so early as these, but of an antiquity which is still
undefined, are two other civilisations with which we became
familiar before the treasure-houses of Egypt and Babylonia
were open to our inquiries. These civilisations occupied the
regions now called India and China.</p>

<p>The circumstances of these two groups are vastly dissimilar
so far as the actual sources of information are concerned; for
in relation to China and India we have paper records, but,
alas! no monuments of undoubtedly high antiquity. It is true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2"> 2</span>
that there are many temples in India in the present day, but, on
the authority of Prof. Max Müller, they are relatively modern.</p>

<p>The contrary happens in Egypt, for there monuments exist
more ancient than any of the inscribed records; monuments
indicating a more or less settled civilisation; a knowledge of
astronomy, and temples erected on astronomical principles for
the purposes of worship, the astronomers being called "the
mystery teachers of Heaven."</p>

<p>We go back in Egypt for a period, as estimated by various
authors, of something like 6,000 or 7,000 years. In Babylonia
inscribed tablets carry us into the dim past for a period of
certainly 5,000 years; but the so-called "omen" tablets
indicate that observations of eclipses and other astronomical
phenomena had been made for some thousands of years before
this period. In China and in India we go back as certainly
to more than 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>When one comes to examine the texts, whether written
on paper or papyrus, burnt in brick, or cut on stone, which
archæologists have obtained from all these sources, we at once
realise that man's earliest observations of the heavenly bodies
in all the regions we have named may very fairly be divided
into three perfectly distinct stages. I do not mean to say that
these stages follow each other exactly, but that at one period
one stage was more developed than another, and so on.</p>

<p>For instance, in the first stage, wonder and worship were
the prevalent features; in the second, there was the need
of applying the observation of celestial phenomena in two
directions, one the direction of utility&mdash;such as the formation
of a calendar and the foundation of years and months; and
the other the astrological direction.</p>

<p>Supplied as we moderns are with the results of astronomical
observation in the shape of almanacs, pocket-books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3"> 3</span>
and the like, it is always difficult, and for most people quite
impossible, to put ourselves in the place and realise the conditions
of a race emerging into civilisation, and having to face
the needs of the struggle for existence in a community which,
in the nature of the case, must have been agricultural. Those
would best succeed who best knew when "to plow and sow,
and reap and mow;" and the only means of knowledge was at
first the observation of the heavenly bodies. It was this, and
not the accident of the possession of an extended plain, which
drove early man to be astronomically minded.</p>

<p>The worship stage would, of course, continue, and the
priests would see to its being properly developed; and the
astrological direction of thought, to which I have referred,
would gradually be connected with it, probably in the interest
of a class neither priestly nor agricultural.</p>

<p>Only more recently&mdash;not at all, apparently, in the early
stage&mdash;were any observations made of any celestial object for
the mere purpose of getting knowledge. We know from the
recent discoveries of Strassmaier and Epping that this stage
was reached at Babylon at least 300 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, at which time
regular calculations were made of the future positions of moon
and planets, and of such extreme accuracy that they could have
been at once utilised for practical purposes. It looks as if
rough determinations of star places were made at about the
same time in Egypt and Babylonia.</p>

<p>This abstract inquiry is now practically the only source
of interest in astronomy to us; we no longer worship the sun;
we no longer believe in astrology; we have our calendar; but
we must have a Nautical Almanac calculated years beforehand,
and some of us like to know a little about the universe
which surrounds us.</p>

<p>It is very curious and interesting to know that the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4"> 4</span>
stage, the stage of worship, is practically missing in the
Chinese annals; the very earliest Chinese observations show
us the Chinese, a thoroughly practical people, trying to get
as much out of the stars as they could for their terrestrial
purposes.</p>

<p>In Babylonia it is a very remarkable thing that from
the beginning of things&mdash;so far as we can judge from the
records&mdash;the sign for God was a star.</p>

<p>We find the same idea in Egypt: in some of the hieroglyphic
texts three stars represented the plural "gods."</p>

<p>I have already remarked that the ideas of the early Indian
civilisation, crystallised in their sacred books called Vedas,
were known to us long before either the Egyptian or the
Babylonian and Assyrian records had been deciphered.</p>

<p>Enough, however, is now known to show that we may
take the Vedas to bring before us the remnants of the first
ideas which dawned upon the minds of the earliest dwellers
in Western Asia&mdash;that is, the territory comprised between
the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Caspian
Sea, the Indus, and the waters which bound the southern
coasts&mdash;say, as far as Cape Comorin. Of these populations,
the Egyptians and Babylonians may be reckoned as the first.
According to Lenormant&mdash;and he is followed by all the best
scholars&mdash;this region was invaded in the earliest times by
peoples coming from the steppes of Northern Asia. Bit by bit
they spread to the west and east. There are strange variants
in the ideas of the Chaldæans already recovered from the
inscriptions and those preserved in the Vedas. Nevertheless,
we find a sun-god<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the following hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Oh Sun, in the most profound heaven thou shinest. Thou openest the
locks which close the high heavens. Thou openest the door of heaven. Oh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5"> 5</span>
Sun, towards the surface of the earth thou turnest thy face. Oh Sun, thou
spreadest above the surface, like a mantle, the splendour of heaven."</p>
</div>

<p>Let us consider for a moment what were the first conditions
under which the stars and the sun would be observed. There
was no knowledge, but we can very well understand that there
was much awe, and fear, and wonder. Man then possessed no
instruments, and the eyes and the minds of the early observers
were absolutely untrained. Further, night to them seemed
almost death&mdash;no man could work; for them there was no
electric light, to say nothing of candles; so that in the absence
of the moon the night reigned like death over every land.
There is no necessity for us to go far into this matter by trying
to put ourselves into the places of these early peoples; we
have only to look at the records: they speak very clearly for
themselves.</p>

<p>But the Vedas speak fully, while as yet information on this
special point is relatively sparse from the other regions. It is
wise, therefore, to begin with India, whence the first complete
revelations of this kind came. Max Müller and others during
recent years have brought before us an immense amount of
most interesting information, of the highest importance for our
present subject.</p>

<p>They tell us that 1,500 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> there was a ritual, a set
of hymns called the Veda (<i>Veda</i> meaning " knowledge"). These
hymns were written in Sanskrit, which a few years ago was
almost an unknown language: we know now that it turns
out to be the nearest relation to our English tongue. The
thoughts and feelings expressed in these early hymns contain
the first roots and germs of that intellectual growth which
connects our own generation with the ancestors of the Aryan
races&mdash;"those very people who, as we now learn from the
Vedas, at the rising and the setting of the sun, listened with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6"> 6</span>
trembling hearts to the sacred songs chanted by their priests.
The Veda, in fact, is the oldest book in which we can study
the first beginnings of our language and of everything which
is embodied in all the languages under the sun." The oldest,
most primitive, most simple form of Aryan Nature-worship
finds expression in this wonderful hymnal, which doubtless
brings before us the rituals of the ancient Aryan populations,
represented also by the Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>There was, however, another branch, represented by the
Zend-Avesta, as opposed to the Vedas, among which there was
a more or less conscious opposition to the gods of Nature, to
which we are about to refer, and a striving after a more spiritual
deity, proclaimed by Zoroaster under the name of Ahura-Mazda,
or Ormuzd. The existence of these rituals side by side in time
tends to throw back the origin of the Nature-worship of both.
Now, what do we find? In the Veda the gods are called Devas,
a word which means "bright"; brightness or light being one of
the most general attributes shared by the various manifestations
of the deity. What were the deities? The sun, the sky, the
dawn, fire, and storm. It is clear, in fact, from the Vedas that
sunrise was, to those from whom the ritual had been derived,
the great revelation of Nature, and in time, in the minds of the
poets of the Veda, <i>deva</i>, from meaning "bright," gradually
came to mean "divine." Sunrise it was that inspired the
first prayers of our race, and called forth the first sacrificial
flames. Here, for instance, is an extract from one of the
Vedas. "Will the sun rise again? Will our old friend the
Dawn come back again? Will the power of Darkness be
conquered by the God of Light?"</p>

<p>These three questions in one hymn will show what a
questionable stage in man's history is thus brought before us,
and how the antithesis between night and day was one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7"> 7</span>
the first things to strike mankind. We find very many names
for Sun-gods&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Mitra, Indra (the day brought by the sun),</li>
<li>Sûrya, Vasishtha, Arusha (bright or red);</li>
</ul>

<p class="pnind">and for the Dawn-gods&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Ushas, Dyaus, Dyotanâ,</li>
<li>Ahanâ, Urvasīī.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have only to consider how tremendously important
must have been the coming of the sun in the morning, bringing
everything with it; and the dying away of the sun in the
evening, followed at once by semi-tropical quick darkness, to
cease to wonder at such worship as this. Here is an extract
from one hymn to the Dawn (Ushas):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"(1) She shines upon us like a young wife, rousing every living being to go
to his work; when the fire had to be kindled by men she made the light by
striking down darkness.</p>

<p>"(2) She rose up spreading far and wide, and moving everywhere, she grew
in brightness, wearing her brilliant garment [the mother of the cows (the
mornings)], the leader of the days, she shone gold-coloured, lovely to behold.</p>

<p>"(3) She, the fortunate, who brings the eye of the gods, who leads the white
and lovely steed (of the sun), the <i>Dawn</i>, was seen revealed by her rays, with
brilliant treasures, following everyone.</p>

<p>"(4) Thou art a blessing when thou art near.... Raise up wealth to the
worshipper, thou mighty <i>Dawn</i>.</p>

<p>"(5) Shine for us with thy best rays, thou bright Dawn....</p>

<p>"(6) Thou daughter of the sky, thou high-born Dawn...."</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the Sun and the Dawn, which turn out to be
the two great deities in the early Indian Pantheon, other gods
are to be met with, such as Prithivī, the Earth on which we
dwell; Varuna, the Sky; Ap, the Waters; Agni, the Fire; and
Maruts, the Storm-gods. Of these, Varuna is especially
interesting to us. We read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Varuna stemmed asunder the wide firmament; he lifted up on high the
bright and glorious heaven; he stretched apart the starry sky and the earth."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8"> 8</span></p>

<p>Again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This earth, too, belongs to Varuna, the king, and this wide sky with its
ends far apart. The two seas (the sky and the ocean) are Varuna's loins."</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, the result of all this astral worship was to give an
idea of the connection between the earth and the sun and the
heavens, which are illustrated in later Indian pictures, bringing
before us modernised and much more concrete views of
these early notions, ultimately transformed into this piece
of poetic thought, that the earth was a shell supported by
elephants (which represent strength), the elephants being supported
on a tortoise (which represents infinite slowness).</p>

<p>This poetical view subsequently gave way to one less
poetical&mdash;namely, that the earth was supported by pillars; on
what the pillars rested is not stated, and it does not matter.
We must not consider this as ridiculous, and pardonable merely
because it is so early in point of time; because, coming to the
time of Greek civilisation, Anaximander told us that the earth
was cylindrical in shape, and every place that was then known
was situated on the flat end of the cylinder; and Plato, on the
ground that the cube was the most perfect geometrical figure,
imagined the earth to be a cube, the part of the earth known to
the Greeks being on the upper surface. In these matters,
indeed, the vaunted Greek mind was little in advance of the
predecessors of the Vedic priests.</p>

<small>THE FIRST GLIMPSES OF EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY.</small></h2></div>

  <div class="caption">THE ROSETTA STONE.<br />(<i>In the British Museum.</i>)</div>
</div>


<p>In the general survey, which occupied the preceding chapter,
of the records left by the most ancient peoples, it was shown
that Egypt, if we consider her monuments, came first in
the order of time. I have next to show that in the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10"> 10</span>
monuments we have evidences of the existence and utilisation
of astronomical knowledge.</p>

<p>It is impossible to approach such a subject as the astronomy
of the ancient Egyptians without being struck with surprise
that any knowledge is available to help us in our inquiries. A
century ago, the man to whom we owe more than to all others
in this matter; the man who read the riddle of those strange
hieroglyphs, which, after having been buried in oblivion for
nearly two thousand years, were then again occupying the
learned, was not yet born. I refer to Champollion, who was
born in 1790 and died in the prime of his manhood and in the
midst of his work, in 1832.</p>

<p>Again, a century ago the French scientific expedition,
planned by the great Napoleon, which collected for the use of
all the world facts of importance connected with the sites, the
buildings, the inscriptions, and everything which could be got
at relating to the life and language of the ancient Egyptians,
had not even been thought of; indeed, it only commenced its
labours in 1798, and the intellectual world will for ever be a
debtor to the man who planned it.</p>

<p>I know of no more striking proof of the wit of man than
the gradual unravelling of the strange hieroglyphic signs in
which the learning of the ancient Egyptians was enshrined;
and there are few things more remarkable in the history
of scientific investigation than the way in which a literature
has been already brought together which is appalling in its
extent; and yet it may well be that, vast as this literature is
at present, it is but the vanguard of a much more stupendous
one to follow; for we are dealing with a nation which we
now know existed completely equipped in many ways at
least seven thousand five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>It forms no part of the present work to give an account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11"> 11</span>
the unravelling to which I have referred, one which finds a
counterpart in the results achieved by the spectroscope in
another scientific field.</p>

<p>But a brief reference to one of the most brilliant achievements
of the century may be permitted, and the more as it will
indicate the importance of one of the most valued treasures in
our national collections. I refer to the Rosetta Stone in the
Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. It was the finding of
this stone in 1799 by Boussard, a captain of French artillery at
Rosetta, which not only showed the baselessness of the systems
of suggested interpretations of the hieroglyphics which had
been in vogue from the time of Kircher downwards, but by its
bilingual record in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek characters,
paved the way for men of genius like Thomas Young
(1814) and Champollion (1822). The latter must be acknowledged
as the real founder of the system of interpretation
which has held its own against all opposition, and has opened
the way to inquiries into the history of the past undreamt of
when the century was young. Chateaubriand nobly said of
him, "Ses admirables travaux auront la durée des monuments
qu'il nous a fait connaître."</p>

<p>The germ of Champollion's discovery consisted in the bringing
together of two sets of characters enclosed in cartouches.
One of them is in the Rosetta inscription itself; the other, on
the plinth of an obelisk in the island of Philæ. The name of
Cleopatra was associated with the one inscription, and that of
Ptolemy with the other. It was clear that if the two names,
written <img src="images/031h1.jpg" alt="Hieroglyph" /> and <img src="images/031h2.jpg" alt="Hieroglyph" />,
were really Ptolemaios and Cleopatra, they must include several
identical signs or letters; in Ptolemaios the quadrangular figure
□, being the first, must stand for <i>P</i>, and this in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12"> 12</span>
Cleopatra was found to occur in the right place, standing fifth
in order. The third sign <img src="images/031h3.jpg" alt="Hieroglyphic" /> in Ptolemaios must be an <i>o</i>, and
the fourth <img src="images/031h4.jpg" alt="Hieroglyph" /> an <i>l</i>. Now the lion for <i>l</i> occurs second in Cleopatra,
and the knotted cord for <i>o</i> fourth. In this way, proceeding
by comparison with other names, that of Alexander, or
Alksantrs, was next discovered, <img src="images/032h1.jpg" alt="Hieroglyph" /> and by
degrees the whole Egyptian alphabet was recovered.</p>

<p>What had come down the stream of ages and were universally
recognised as unsurpassed memorials of a mysterious
past were the famous pyramids, successively described by
Herodotus, Diodorus and Pliny among classical, and Abd
el-Latîf among Arabian, chroniclers.</p>

<p>Although the rifling of the most important of these structures
for the purpose of finding treasure dates at least as far
back as 820 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the Khalîf El-Mamun being the destroyer,
the scientific study of their mode and objects of construction
is a work of quite modern times, and may be said to have
been inaugurated by Colonel Howard Vyse in 1839.</p>

<p>Much that has been written has been wild and nonsensical,
but from the exact descriptions and measures now available,
it is impossible to doubt that these structures <i>were erected by a
people possessing much astronomical knowledge</i>. The exact orientation
of the larger pyramids in the pyramid-field of Gîzeh has
been completely established, and it is not impossible that some
of the mysterious passages to be found in the pyramid of
Cheops may have had an astronomical use.</p>

<p>Let us, to continue the subject-matter of the present chapter,
come to the year 1820. It was about then that were gathered
some of the first-fruits of the investigations carried on by the
Commission to which I have referred; that some translations of
the inscriptions had been attempted, and that, some of the new
results were discussed by the members of the French Academy,
while at the same time they astounded and delighted the
outside world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13"> 13</span></p>

  <div class="caption">TEMPLE OF EDFÛ, LOOKING EAST: SHOWING PYLON AND OUTER COURT.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14"> 14</span></p>
<p>From the point of view which now concerns us, it may be
said that the new discoveries might be arranged into three
different groups. First of all, the land had been found full of
temples, vast and majestic beyond imagination; among these
the temples at Karnak were supreme, but there were others on
a par with them in points of architectural detail. But besides
these, then as now, above ground and inviting inspection, there
were many others which were then&mdash;as undoubtedly many are
still&mdash;more or less buried in the sand; some of these have
since been unearthed to reveal the striking features of their
structure.</p>

<p>I shall show subsequently that, on the evidence of the
ancient Egyptians themselves, these temples were constructed
in strict relation to stars; they, then, like the pyramids, must
be taken as indicating astronomical knowledge.</p>

<p>If we deal with the general external appearance of the
temples, they may be arranged architecturally into two main
groups. Edfû is the most perfect example of the first
group, characterised by having a pylon consisting of two
massive structures right and left of the entrance, which are
somewhat like the two towers that one sometimes sees on the
west front of our English cathedrals.</p>

<p>In Denderah we have an example of the second group,
in which the massive pylon is omitted. In these the front is
entirely changed; instead of the pylon we have now an open
front to the temple with columns&mdash;the Greek form of temple is
approached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15"> 15</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_p015" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p015.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GREAT COURT OF HEAVEN, AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HATHOR TEMPLE

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16"> 16</span></p>

<p>Associated with many of the temples, frequently but not
universally in close proximity to the propylon, were obelisks,
often of gigantic proportions, exceeding one hundred feet
in height and many hundreds of tons in weight, which it has
since been discovered were hewn out of the syenite quarry
at Aswân, and floated down the river to the various places
where they were to be erected.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go to Egypt to see these wonderful
monoliths, for they have been carried away from their original
temple sites at Thebes and Heliopolis to adorn more modern
cities in the Western world. London, Paris, Rome, and
Constantinople are thus embellished. It is obvious to anyone
acquainted with astronomical history and methods, that some
of these structures, at all events, may have served as gnomons.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_p016" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p016.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">TEMPLE GATE WITH PROPYLON AND OBELISKS.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes these temples, instead of being entirely constructed
of stone on a level surface, were either entirely or
partly rock-hewn. Of the former class, the temple of Abu Simbel
is the most striking example; of the latter, the temple of Dêr
el-Bahari at Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17"> 17</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18"> 18</span></p>

<p>The second revelation was that the walls of these temples,
and of many funereal buildings, were, for the most part,
covered with inscriptions in the language which was then but
gradually emerging from the unknown, its very alphabet and
syllabary being still incomplete. Hence there was not only a
great wealth of temple buildings, but a still more wonderful
wealth of temple inscriptions.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p018" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p018.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE CIRCULAR ZODIAC OF DENDERAH.</div>
</div>

<p>There was even more than this, and something more germane
to our present purpose. In several temples which
were examined, zodiacs&mdash;undoubted zodiacs, representing a
third group of finds&mdash;were discovered; these, also, were accompanied
by inscriptions of an obviously astronomical nature.</p>

<p>At the first blush, then, it seemed to be perfectly certain
that we had to deal with a people of an astronomical turn of
mind; and here was the opportunity for the astronomer,
which indeed the French astronomers did not fail to make use of.
Where the philologist was for the moment dumb, it seemed
as if the astronomer could be of use, giving explanations, fixing
probable dates on the one hand; while, on the other, he would
certainly be gaining a fresh insight into, and possibly filling a
tremendous gap in, the history of his science.</p>

<p>The figure on the preceding page gives an idea of the
method of presentation generally employed in these zodiacs.</p>

<p>I shall show in the sequel&mdash;for I shall have to deal with this
part of my subject at full length in a subsequent chapter&mdash;that

personages and actual constellations.</p>

<small>THE ASTRONOMICAL BASIS OF THE EGYPTIAN PANTHEON.</small></h2></div>


<p>It will be abundantly clear from the statements made in the
foregoing chapter that, as I have said, the main source of
information touching things Egyptian consists no longer in
writings like the Vedas, but in the inscriptions on the
monuments, and the monuments themselves. It is true that,
in addition to the monuments, we have the Book of the
Dead, and certain records found in tombs; but, in the main,
the source of information which has been most largely drawn
upon consists in the monuments themselves&mdash;the zodiacs being
included in that term.</p>

<p>It has been impossible, up to the present time, to fix with
great accuracy the exact date of the earliest monuments. This
should not surprise us. We must all feel that it is not a question
of knowing so little&mdash;it is a question of knowing anything
at all. When one considers that at the beginning of this
century not a sign on any of these monuments was understood,
and that now the wonderful genius of a small number
of students has enabled Egyptologists to read the inscriptions
with almost as much ease and certainty as we read our morning
papers: <i>this</i> is what is surprising, and not the fact that we as
yet know so little, and in many cases lack certainty.</p>

<p>But we already know that probably some of these monuments
are nearly 6,000 years old. This has been determined
by the convergence of many lines of evidence.</p>

  <div class="caption">TABLET OF KINGS AT ABYDOS.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22"> 22</span></p>

<p>One of the many points already profoundly investigated by
Egyptologists has been the chronology of the kings of Egypt
from their first monarch, whom all students recognise as Mena
or Menes. All these inquirers have come to the definite conclusion
that there was a King Mena, and that he reigned a
long time ago; but with all their skill the final result is that
they cannot agree to the date of this king within a thousand
years; one reason among many others being that in these early
days astronomy was a science still to be cultivated, and therefore
the early Egyptians had not a perfect mode of recording;
perhaps even they had no idea of a hundred years as we have.
We are told that all their reckonings were the reckonings of
the reigns of kings. This is difficult to believe, and the statement
may be a measure of our ignorance of their method of
record. We now, fortunately for us, have a calendar which
enables us to deal with large intervals of time, but still we
sometimes reckon, in Egyptian fashion, by the reigns of kings
in our Acts of Parliament. Furthermore, Egypt being then a
country liable to devastating wars, and to the temporary
supremacy of different kingly tribes, it has been very difficult
to disentangle the various lists of kings so as to obtain one
chronological line, for the reasons that sometimes there were
different kings reigning at the same time in different regions.
The latest date for King Mena is, according to Bunsen, 3600
years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; the earliest date, assigned by Boeckh, 5702 years
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; Unger, Brugsch, and Lepsius give, respectively, 5613,
4455, 3892. For our purpose we will call the date 4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;that
is 6,000 years ago&mdash;and for the present consider this
as the start-point for the long series of remains of various
orders to which reference has been made, and from which
alone information can be obtained.</p>

<p>We come now to deal with the ideas of the early inhabitants
of the Nile valley. We find that in Egypt we are in presence
absolutely of the worship of the Sun and of the accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23"> 23</span>
Dawn. Whatever be the date of the Indian
ideas to which we have referred, we find
them in Egypt in the earliest times. The
ancient Egyptians, whether they were separate
from, or more or less allied in their origin to,
the early inhabitants of India, had exactly
the same view of Nature-worship, and we
find in their hymns and the lists of their
gods that the Dawn and the Sunrise were the
great revelations of Nature, and the things
which were most important to man; <i>and therefore
everything connected with the Sunrise and the
Dawn was worshipped</i>.</p>

<div class="figright illowp30" id="i_p023" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p023.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HARPOCRATES.</div>
</div>

<p>Renouf, one of the latest writers on these
subjects, says:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "I fear Egyptologists will
soon be accused, like other persons, of seeing
the dawn everywhere," and he quotes with approbation this
passage from Max Müller relating to the Veda:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I look upon the sunrise and sunset, on the daily return of day and night,
on the battle between light and darkness, on the whole solar drama in all its
details, that is acted every day, every month, every year, in heaven and in earth,
as the principal subject."</p>
</div>

<p>But we must now go somewhat further into detail. The
various apparent movements of the heavenly bodies which are
produced by the rotation and the revolution of the earth, and
the effects of precession, were familiar to the Egyptians, however
ignorant they may have been of their causes; they carefully
studied what they saw, and attempted to put their
knowledge together in the most convenient fashion, associating
it with their strange imaginings and their system of worship.</p>

<p>Dealing with the earth's rotation, how did the Egyptians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24"> 24</span>
picture it? How was this interaction, so to speak, between
the earth and the sky mythologically represented? They
naturally would be familiar with the phenomena of dawn and
sunset, more familiar certainly with the phenomenon of dawn
than we are, because they had a climate much better suited for
its study than ours. There can be no doubt that the wonderful
scenes which they saw every morning and evening were the
first things which impressed them, and they came to consider
the earth as a god, surrounded by the sky&mdash;another god.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_p024" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p024.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="gap4r">RA.</span> <span class="gap4r">MIN-RĀ.</span>  AMEN-RĀ.</div>
</div>

<p>I have next to point out that, the sun being very generally
worshipped in Egypt, there were various forms of the sun-god,
depending upon the positions occupied in its daily course. We
have the form of Harpocrates at its rising, the child sun-god
being generally represented by the figure of a hawk. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25"> 25</span>
in human form, we notice the presence of a side lock of hair.
The god Rā symbolises, it is said, the sun in his noontide
strength; while for the time of sunset we have various names,
chiefly Osiris, Tum, or Atmu, the dying sun represented by a
mummy and typifying old age. The hours of the day were
also personified, the twelve changes during the twelve hours
being mythically connected with the sun's daily movement
across the sky.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_p025" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p025.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="gap6r">SEBAK-RĀ.</span>    CHNEMU-RĀ.</div>
</div>

<p>We often find Rā compounded with other names, and in
these forms of the god we possibly get references to the
sun at different times of the year. Amen-Rā, Sebak-Rā, and
Chnemu-Rā are cases in point. The former undoubtedly
refers to the sun at the summer solstice. Min-Rā is an
ithyphallic form.</p>

Chepera (morning sun).</p>

<p>Rā (noon).</p>

<p>Tum or Atmu (evening sun).</p>

</div>

<p>I have not space to quote the
many hymns to the Sun-gods
which have been recovered from
the inscriptions, but the following
extracts will show that the
worship was in the main at sunrise
or sunset&mdash;in other words,
that the <i>horizon</i> was in question:&mdash;</p>

<p>So far we have dealt with the powers of sunlight; but
the ancient Egyptians, like ourselves, were familiar with
the powers of darkness or of the underworld. The chief
god antithetical to the sun was variously named&mdash;Sit, Set, Sut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28"> 28</span>
Anubis, Typhon, Bes; and a host of other names was
given to him. As I shall show, the idea of darkness was
associated with the existence of those stars which never set,
so that even here the symbolism was astronomical.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p028" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p028.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">VARIOUS FORMS OF BES&mdash;AS WARRIOR, MUSICIAN, AND BUFFOON.</div>
</div>

<p>The contrast between the representations of Bes and of the
other forms suggests that the former was imported. In the
form of Typhon the goddess Taurt is represented as a hippopotamus,
while for Anubis the emblem is a jackal.</p>

<p>In all illustrations of funeral ceremonies the above-mentioned
figure largely. In the Book of the Dead we find that in the
representations of the judgment of the dead, besides Osiris
we have Anubis, both responsible for the weighing of the
soul.</p>

<p>With the moon we find two gods connected&mdash;Thoth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"> 29</span>lunus
and Khons-lunus&mdash;though the connection is not a very
obvious one.</p>

<p>Thoth is also associated with the Egyptian year, and is
variously represented; all forms, however, are based upon
the ibis.</p>

<p>For the stars generally we find a special goddess, Sesheta.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_p029" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p>Thoth as the sacred scribe and Sesheta as the star-goddess
are often represented together engaged in writing.</p>

<p>Associated with the phenomena of morning and evening
we find the following divinities. The attributes stated are
those now generally accepted. This is a subject which will
occupy us in the sequel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Isis</i> represents the Dawn and the Twilight; she prepares the way for the

<p><i>Nephthys</i> is the Dawn and the Twilight, sometimes Sunset.</p>

<p><i>Shu</i> is also the Dawn, or sunlight, Tefnut represents the coloured rays at
dawn. Shu and Tefnut are the eyes of Horus. Shu was also called "Neshem,"
which means green felspar, in consequence of the green colour observed at dawn.
The green tint at dawn and sunset are represented further by the "sycamore of
emerald." Sechet is another goddess of the Dawn, the fiery Dawn.</p>

  <div class="caption">ISIS (SEATED).</div>
</div>

<p>We next have to gain some general idea of the Egyptian
cosmogony&mdash;the relation of the sun and dawn to the sky;
this is very different from the Indian view. The Sky is Nu
or Nu-t, represented as a female figure bending over Seb,
the Earth, with her feet on one horizon and her finger-tips
on the other. Seb is represented by a recumbent figure,
while the sky, represented by the goddess Nu-t, is separated
from the earth by Shu, the god of air or sunlight. The daily
journey of the sun is represented by a god in a boat traversing
the sky from east to west. The goddess Nu-t is variously
symbolised. Sometimes there is a line of stars along her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"> 34</span>
back, which clearly defines her nature, but sometimes she is
represented by a figure in which the band of stars is accompanied
by a band of water. This suggests the Jewish idea of
the firmament. We read of the firmament in the midst of
the waters, which divided the waters from the waters, the
waters above being separated from the waters below the
firmament.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p034" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p034.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE RISING SUN HORUS BETWEEN ISIS AND NEPHTHYS.</div>
</div>

<p>It would seem that it was not very long before the
Egyptians saw that the paths of the sun and stars above the
horizon were extremely unequal: in the case of the sun, at
different times of the year; in the case of the stars, depending
upon their position near the equator or either pole. In this
way, perhaps, we may explain a curious variant of the drawing
of the goddess Nu-t, in which she is represented double, a larger
one stretching over a smaller one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35"> 35</span></p>

<p>Not only the Sun-gods, but the stars, were supposed to travel
in boats across the firmament from one horizon to the other.
The underworld was the abode of the dead; and daily
the sun, and the stars which set, died on passing to the
regions of the west, or Amenti, below the western horizon,
to be born again on the eastern horizon on the morrow.
In this we have the germ of the Egyptian idea of immortality.</p>

<p>Among other gods which may be mentioned are Chnemu,
the "Moulder," who was thought to possess some of the
attributes of Rā; and Ptah, the "Opener," who is at times
represented with Isis and Nephthys, and then appears as
a form of Osiris.</p>

<p>We can now begin to glimpse the Egyptian mythology.</p>

<p>Seb, the Earth, was the husband of Nu-t, the Sky; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36"> 36</span>
the Sun-and Dawn-gods and-goddesses were their children,
as also were Shu representing sunlight, and Tefnut representing
the flames of dawn.</p>

<p>Maāt, the goddess of law, was the daughter of Rā.</p>

  <div class="caption">VARIOUS FORMS OF SHU.</div>
</div>

<p>We know several points regarding Egyptian customs
independently of the astronomical inscriptions, properly so-called,
to which I have called attention. We know that there
were sacrifices at daybreak; we know that stars were watched
before sunrise, and heralded the dawn; we know that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"> 37</span>
observations were among the chief duties of the sacrificial
priests, and it is obvious that a knowledge of star-places, as
well as star-names, must have been imperative to these
morning watchers, who eventually compiled lists of decans&mdash;that
is, lists of belts of stars extending round the heavens,
the risings of which followed each other by ten days or so.
These are the exact equivalents of the moon-stations which
the Indians, Arabians, and other peoples invented for the
same purpose. We also find, more or less indeterminately
from inscriptions in some graves at Thebes, that the daily
risings of the chief stars were observed very carefully throughout
the year. Unfortunately the inscriptions in question are
very difficult indeed to co-ordinate. There have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38"> 38</span>
various efforts made to connect them with certain stars, but,
so far, I am afraid they have resisted all efforts to get a
complete story out of them, though certain very important
points have been made out. These points I shall consider
later.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p038" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p038.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FORMS OF PTAH, THE GOD OF MEMPHIS.</div>
</div>

<p>It is not too early to point out here that there is evidence
that the Egyptian pantheon, as I have stated it, had not a
simple origin. There are traditions that many of the gods
came from a region indeterminately described as the land of
Pun-t. Among these gods are Chnemu, Amen-Rā, Hathor,
and Bes. On page 28 I have associated Bes with Typhon,
following several authorities, but if they are right it is
very difficult to understand his <i>rôle</i>. It may also be added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39"> 39</span>
that the temple-evidence supports the view of his foreign
origin.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When one comes to consider the Rig-Veda and the
Egyptian monuments from an astronomical point of view,
one is struck by the fact that, in both, the early worship and
all the early observations related to the horizon. This was
true not only of the sun, with which so far we have exclusively
dealt, but it was equally true of the stars which studded
the general expanse of sky.</p>

<p>In Egypt, then, as in India, the pantheon was astronomical
and, to a very large extent, solar in origin. I shall have to show
that the remainder&mdash;nearly the whole of it&mdash;had its origin in
stellar relations.</p>

<small>THE TWO HORIZONS.</small></h2></div>


<p>It is not only of the first importance for our subject, but
of great interest in itself, to study some of the astronomical
problems connected with this horizon worship, which in
the previous chapter we have found to be common to the
early peoples of India and Egypt.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p040" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p040.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE STARS TO AN OBSERVER AT THE NORTH POLE.</div>
</div>

<p>We must be perfectly clear before we go further what
this horizon really is, and for this some diagrams are
necessary.</p>

<p>The horizon of any place is the circle which bounds our
view of the earth's surface, along which the land (or sea)
and sky appear to meet. We have to consider the relation
of the horizon of any place to the apparent movements of
celestial bodies at that place.</p>

<p>We know, by means of the demonstration afforded by
Foucault's pendulum, that the earth rotates on its axis, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41"> 41</span>
this idea was, of course, quite foreign to these early peoples.
Since the earth rotates with stars, infinitely removed, surrounding
it on all sides, the apparent movements of the stars
will depend very much upon the position we happen to
occupy on the earth: this can be made quite clear by a few
diagrams.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p041" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p041.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE STARS TO AN OBSERVER AT THE EQUATOR.</div>
</div>

<p>An observer at the North Pole of the earth, for instance,
would see the stars moving round in circles parallel to the
horizon. No star would either rise or set&mdash;one half of the
heavens would be always visible above his horizon, and the
other half invisible; whereas an observer at the South Pole
would see that half of the stars invisible to the observer at
the northern one, because it was the half below the N. horizon.
If the observer be on the equator, the movements of the
stars all appear as indicated in the above diagram&mdash;that
is, all the stars will rise and set, and each star in turn
will be half its time above the horizon, and half its time
below it. But if we consider the position of an observer in
middle latitude, say in London, we find that some stars will
always be above the horizon, some always below&mdash;that is,
they will neither rise nor set. All other stars will both rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42"> 42</span>
and set, but some of them will be above the horizon for a
long time and below for a short time, whereas others will be
a very short time above the horizon and a long time below it.</p>

<p>At <i>O</i> we imagine an observer to be in latitude 45° (that is,
half-way between the equator in latitude 0°, and the North
Pole in latitude 90°), hence the North Celestial Pole will be
half-way between the zenith and the horizon; and close to the
pole he will see the stars describing circles, inclined, however,
and not retaining the same distance from the horizon. As the
eye leaves the pole, the stars rise and set obliquely, describe
larger circles, gradually dipping more and more under the
horizon, until, when the celestial equator is reached, half their
journey is performed below it. Still going south, we find the
stars rising less and less above the horizon, until, as there were
northern stars that never dip below the horizon, so there are
southern stars which never appear above it. <i>D D′</i> shows the
apparent path of a circumpolar star; <i>B B′ B″</i> the path and

  <div class="caption">A TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WITH WAFER ATTACHED TO SHOW THE VARYING CONDITIONS
OF OBSERVATION IN A MIDDLE LATITUDE.</div>
</div>

<p>Wherever we are upon the earth we always imagine
that we are on the top of it. The idea held by all the
early peoples was that the earth was an extended plain: they
imagined that the land that they knew and just the surrounding
lands were really in the centre of the extended
plain. Plato, for instance, as we have seen, was content to
put the Mediterranean and Greece upon the top of his cube,
and Anaximander placed the same region at the top of his
cylinder.</p>

<p>We can very conveniently study the conditions of observation
at the poles of the earth, the equator, and some place
in middle latitude, by using an ordinary terrestrial globe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44"> 44</span>
The wooden horizon of the globe is parallel to the horizon of
a place at the top of the globe, which horizon we can represent
by a wafer. In this way we can get a very concrete
idea of the different relations of the observer's horizon in
different latitudes to the apparent paths of the stars.</p>

<p>We have next to deal with the astronomical relations of
the horizon of any place in connection with the worship of
the sun and stars at the times of rising or setting, when, of
course, they are on or near the horizon; and in order to
bring this matter nearer to the ancient monuments, it will be
convenient to study this question for Thebes, where they exist
in greatest number and have been most accurately described.</p>

<p>To adjust things properly we must rectify the globe
to the latitude of 25° 40′ N., or, in other words, incline the axis
of the globe at that angle to the wooden horizon.</p>

<p>It will be at once seen that the inclination of the axis
to the horizon is very much less than in the case of London.
Since all the stars which pass between the North Pole and
the horizon cannot set, all their apparent movement will
take place above the horizon. All the stars between the
horizon and the South Pole will never rise. Hence, stars
within the distance of 25° from the North Pole will never
set at Thebes, and those stars within 25° of the South Pole
will never be visible there. At any place the latitude and
the elevation of the pole are the same. It so happens that
all these places with which archæologists have to do in
studying the history of early peoples, Egypt, Babylonia,
Assyria, China, Greece, &amp;c., are in middle latitudes, therefore
we have to deal with bodies in the skies, which do
set, and bodies which do not; and the elevation of the pole
is neither very great nor very small. In each different latitude
the inclination of the equator to the horizon, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45"> 45</span>
as the elevation of the pole, will vary, but there will be a
strict relationship between the inclination of the equator at
each place and the elevation of the pole. Except at the
poles themselves the equator will cut the horizon due east
and due west. Therefore every celestial body which rises
or sets to the north of the equator will cut the horizon between
the east or west point and the north point; those bodies which
do not set will, of course, not cut the horizon at all.</p>

<p>The sun, and stars near the equator, in such a latitude
as that of Thebes, will appear to rise or set at no very considerable
angle to the vertical; but when we deal with stars
rising or setting near to the north or south points of the
horizon they will seem to skim along the horizon instead of
rising or setting vertically.</p>

<p>Now it will at once be obvious that there must be a strict
law connecting the position of the sun (or a star) with its
place of rising or setting. Stars at the same distance from
either of the celestial poles will rise or set at the same point
of the horizon, and if a star does not change its place in the
heavens it will always rise or set in the same place.</p>

<p>Here it will be convenient to introduce one or two technical
terms. Every celestial body, whether we deal with
the sun, moon, planet, or star, occupies at any moment a
certain place in the sky, partly, though not wholly, defined
by what we term its declination, <i>i.e.</i>, its distance from the
celestial equator. This declination is one of the two co-ordinates
which are essential for enabling us to state accurately
the position of any body on the celestial vault; and
we must quite understand that if all these bodies rise and
set, and rise and set visibly, the place of their rising or
setting must be very closely connected with their declination.
Bodies with the same declination will rise at the same points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"> 46</span>
of the horizon. When the declination changes, of course
the body will rise and set in different points of the horizon.</p>

<p>Next we define points on the horizon by dividing the
whole circumference into four quadrants of 90° each = 360°,
so that we can have <i>azimuths</i> of 90° from the north or south
points to the east and west points.</p>

<p>Azimuths are not always reckoned in this way, navigators
preferring one method, while astronomers prefer another.
Thus azimuth may also be taken as the distance measured in
degrees from the south point in a direction passing through the
west, north, and east points. On this system, a point can have
an azimuth varying from 0° to 360°.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p046" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p046.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SHOWING AMPLITUDES RECKONED FROM THE EAST OR WEST POINTS TO N.P., NORTH
POINT OF HORIZON, AND S.P., SOUTH POINT OF HORIZON.</div>
</div>

<p>It is next important to define the term <i>amplitude</i>. The
amplitude of a body on the horizon is its distance north and
south of the east and west points; it is always measured to
the nearest of these two latter points, so that its greatest
value can never exceed 90°. For instance, the south point
itself would have an amplitude of 90° south of west (generally
written W. 90° S.), or 90° south of east (E. 90° S.), while a
point 2° to the westward of south would have an amplitude of
W. 88° S., and not E. 92° S.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47"> 47</span></p>

<p>We can say then that a star of a certain declination
will rise or set at such an <i>azimuth</i>, if we reckon from the
N. point of the horizon, or at such an amplitude if we reckon
from the <i>equator</i>. This will apply to both north and south
declinations.</p>

<p>The following table gives for Thebes the amplitudes of
rising or setting (north or south) of celestial bodies having
declinations from 0° to 64°; bodies with higher declinations
than 64° never set at Thebes if they are north, or never
rise if they are south, as the latitude (and therefore the
elevation of the pole) there is nearly 26°.</p>

<p>The absolute connection, then, between the declination of a
heavenly body and the amplitude at which it rises and sets is
obvious from the above table: given the declination we know
the amplitude; given the amplitude we know the declination.</p>

<p>Suppose we were dealing with a sea horizon: all the bodies
rising or setting at the same instant of time would be in a
great circle round the heavens, for the plane of the sensible
horizon is parallel to the geocentric one.</p>

<p>But there are some additional points to be borne in mind.
Ordinarily we should determine that the amplitude being so
and so, the declination of the body which rose or set with
that amplitude would be so and so, taking the horizon to be an
all-round horizon like a sea one. But that would not be quite
true, because we generally see the sun, to take an instance, some
little time before it really rises and after it has set, owing to
refraction. So that if we see the sun setting, say, north of west,
we know that when we see it setting it appears really a little
further to the north than it actually was at the moment of true
sunset, because refraction gives us the position of the sun just
below the true horizon. That is one point that we have to
consider. Another is that, of course, we as a rule do not deal
with sea horizons. Here we find a hill, there some other
obstacle; so that it is necessary to make a correction depending
on the height of the hill or other obstacle above the
sea-or true-horizon at the place. Only when we take these
things completely into consideration, can we determine absolutely
the declination, or distance from the celestial equator,
of the body at the moment of rising or setting. Still, it is
worth while noting that when only approximations are required,
the refraction-and hill-corrections have a tendency to
neutralise each other in the northern hemisphere. Refraction
will tend to carry the sunrise or sunset place more to the north,
hills will cause the body to appear to rise or set more to
the south.</p>

IN DIFFERENT LATITUDES.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50"> 50</span></p>

<p>It is important to point out that these corrections vary very
considerably in importance according to the declination of the
star with which we have to deal. With a high north or south
declination the amplitude increases very rapidly, and the more
it increases the more the corrections for refraction and elevation
above the true horizon to which I have referred become of
importance. In all cases the correction has to be made so that
the amplitude will be increased or decreased from the true
amplitude by this effect of refraction, according as the body&mdash;whether
sun or star&mdash;is seen to the north or south of the
equator.</p>

<p>In the diagram given on page 49, the various amplitudes
are shown at which bodies of different declinations appear to
rise and set in places with latitudes ranging from 19° to 51° N.
It is a diagram to which frequent reference will be made in

<small>THE YEARLY PATH OF THE SUN-GOD.</small></h2></div>


<p>Let us, then, imagine the ancient Egyptians, furnished with the
natural astronomical circle which is provided whenever there is
an extended plain, engaged in their worship at sunrise, praying
to the "Lord of the two Horizons." The rising (and setting)
of stars we will consider later; it is best to begin with those
observations about which there is the least question.</p>

<p>In the very early observations that were made in Egypt
and Babylonia, when the sun was considered to be a god
who every morning got into his boat and floated across space,
there was no particular reason for considering the amplitude
at which the supposed boat left or approached the
horizon. But a few centuries showed that this rising or setting
of the sun in widely varying amplitudes at different parts of
the year depended upon a very definite law. We now, more
fortunate than the early Egyptians, of course know exactly
what this law is, and with a view of following their early
attempts to grapple with the difficulties presented to them we
must pass to the yearly path of the sun, in order to study the
relation of the various points of the horizon occupied by the
sun at different times in the year.</p>

<p>Not many years ago Foucault gave us a means of
demonstrating the fact that the earth rotates on its axis. We
have also a perfect method of demonstrating that the earth not
only rotates on its axis once a day, but that it moves round
the sun once a year, an idea which was undreamt of by
the ancients. As a pendulum shows us the rotation, so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52"> 52</span>
determination of the aberration of light demonstrates for us the
revolution of the earth round the sun.</p>

<p>We have, then, the earth endowed with these two movements&mdash;a
rotation on its axis in a day, and a revolution round
the sun in a year. To see the full bearing of this on our present
inquiry, we must for a time return to the globe or model
of the earth.</p>

<p>To determine the position of any place on the earth's surface
we say that it is so many degrees distant from the equator, and
also so many degrees distant from the longitude of Greenwich:
we have two rectangular co-ordinates, latitude and longitude.
When we conceive the earth's equator extended to the heavens,
we have a means of determining the positions of stars in the
heavens exactly similar to the means we have of determining the
position of any place on the earth. We have already defined
distance from the equator as north or south declination in the
case of a star, as we have north latitude or south latitude in
case of a place on the earth. With regard to the other
co-ordinate, we can also say that the heavenly body whose
place we are anxious to determine is at a certain distance
from our first point of measurement, whatever that may be,
along the celestial equator. Speaking of heavenly bodies, we
call this distance right ascension; dealing with matters earthy,
we measure from the meridian of Greenwich and call the
distance longitude.</p>

<p>The movement of the earth round the sun is in a plane
which is called the plane of the ecliptic, and the axis of
rotation of the earth is inclined to that plane at an angle of
something like 23½°. We can if we choose use the plane of the
ecliptic to define the positions of the stars as we use the plane
of the earth's equator. In that case we talk of distance
from the ecliptic as celestial latitude, and along the ecliptic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53"> 53</span>
from one of the points where it cuts the celestial equator as
celestial longitude. The equator, then, cuts the ecliptic at two
points: one of these is chosen for the start-point of measurement
along both the equator and the ecliptic, and is called the
first point of Aries.</p>

<p>We have, then, two systems of co-ordinates, by each of
which we can define the position of the sun or a star in the
heavens: equatorial co-ordinates dealing with the earth's
equator, ecliptic co-ordinates dealing with the earth's orbit.
Knowing that the earth moves round the sun once a year, the
year to us moderns is defined with the most absolute accuracy.
In fact, we have three years: we have a sidereal year&mdash;that is,
the time taken by the earth to go through exactly 360° of
longitude; we have what is called the tropical year, which
indicates the time taken by the earth to go through not quite
360°, to go from the first point of Aries till she meets it again;
and since the equinoctial point advances to meet the earth, we
talk about the precession of the equinoxes; this year is the
sidereal year minus twenty minutes. Then there is also another
year called the anomalistic year, which depends upon the movement
of the point in the earth's orbit where the earth is nearest
to the sun; this is running away, so to speak, from the first point
of Aries, instead of advancing to meet it, so that in this case
we get the sidereal year plus nearly five minutes.</p>

<p>The angle of the inclination of the earth's plane of rotation
to the plane of its revolution round the sun, which, as I have
said, is at the present time something like 23½°, is called <i>the
obliquity of the ecliptic</i>. This obliquity is subject to a slight
change, to which I shall refer in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>In order to give a concrete idea of the most important
points in the yearly path of the earth round the sun, let us
imagine four globes arranged on a circle representing the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54"> 54</span>
at different points of its orbit, with another globe in the centre
representing the sun, marking the two practically opposite
points of the earth's orbit, in which the axis is not inclined to
or from the sun but is at right angles to the line joining the
earth in these two positions, and the two opposite and intermediate
points at which the north pole of the axis is most
inclined towards and away from the sun.</p>

<p>A diagram will show what will happen under these
conditions. If we take first the points at which the axis,
instead of being inclined towards the sun, is inclined at right
angles to it, it is perfectly obvious that we shall get a condition
of things in which the movement of the earth on its axis will
cause the dark side of the earth and also the light side represented
by the side nearest to the sun, both being of equal areas,
to extend from pole to pole; so that any place on the earth
rotating under those conditions will be brought for half a period
of rotation into the sunlight, and be carried for half a period of
the rotation out of the sunlight; the day, therefore, will be of
the same length as the night, and the days and nights will
therefore be equal all over the world.</p>

<p>We call this the time of the equinoxes; the nights are of the
same length as the day in both these positions of the earth
with regard to the sun.</p>

  <div class="caption">EARTH AND SUN AT THE EQUINOXES.</div>

<p>In the next figure we have the other condition. Here the
earth's axis is inclined at the greatest angle of 23°½, towards, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55"> 55</span>
away from, the sun. If I take a point very near the north
pole, that point will not, in summer, be carried by the earth's
rotation out of the light, and a part equally near the south pole
will not be able to get into it. These are the conditions at and
near two other points called the solstices.</p>

<p>On each of these globes I have drawn a line representing the
overhead direction from London. If we observe the angle
between the direction of the zenith and that to the sun in
winter we find it considerable; but if we take the opposite
six-monthly condition we get a small angle.</p>

<p>In other words, under the first condition the sun at noon
will be far from the zenith of London, we shall have winter;
and in the other condition the sun will be as near as it can be
to the zenith at noon, we shall have summer. These two cases
represent the two points in the earth's orbit at which the sun
has the greatest declination south and north. With the greatest
north declination the sun will come up high, appear to remain at
the same height above the horizon at noon for a day or two, as
it does at our summer solstice, and then go down again; at the
other point, when it has the greatest southern declination, it
will go down to the lowest point, as it does in our winter, stop,
and come up again&mdash;that is, the sun will stand still, so far as
its height above the horizon at noon is concerned, and the
Latin word solstice exactly expresses that idea. We have, then,
two opposite points in the revolution of the earth round the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"> 56</span>
at which we have equal altitudes of the sun at noon, two
others when the altitude is greatest and least.</p>

<p>We get the equal altitudes at the equinoxes, and the
greatest and the least at the solstices.</p>

<p>These altitudes depend upon the change of the sun's declination.
The change of declination will affect the azimuth and
amplitude of the sun's rising and setting; this is why, in our
northern hemisphere, the sun rises and sets most to the north
in summer and most to the south in winter. At the equinoxes
the sun has always 0° Decl., so it rises and sets due east and
west all over the world. But at the solstices it has its greatest
declination of 23½° N. or S.; it will rise and set, therefore, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57"> 57</span>
from the east and west points; how far, will depend on the
latitude of the place we consider. The following are approximate
values:</p>

<p>At Thebes, Lat. 25° 40′ N., representing Egypt, we find
that the amplitude of the sun at rising or setting at the
summer solstice will be approximately 26° N. of E. at rising,
and 26° N. of W. at setting.</p>

<p>These solstices and their accompaniments are among the
striking things in the natural world. At the winter solstice we
have the depth of winter, at the summer solstice we have the
height of summer; while at the equinoxes we have but
transitional changes; in other words, while the solstices point,
out for us the conditions of greatest heat and greatest cold, the
equinoxes point out for us those two times of the year at which
the temperature conditions are very nearly equal, although of
course in the one case we are saying good-bye to summer and
in the other to winter. In Egypt the summer solstice was
paramount, for it occurred at the time of the rise of the Nile,
the beginning of the Egyptian year.</p>

<p>Did the ancients know anything about these solstices and
these equinoxes? Were the almost mythical Hor-shesu or
sun-worshippers familiar with the annual course of the sun?
That is one of the questions which we have to discuss.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE PROBABLE HOR-SHESU WORSHIP.</small></h2></div>


<p>At the end of the last chapter I referred to the Hor-shesu or
followers, that is worshippers, of the Sun-god Horus. I shall
have to refer to the traditions relating to them at a later stage,
but it is well that I should state here that those personages who
preceded the true historic period are considered by De Rougé
and others to represent "<i>le type de l'antiquité la plus reculée</i>."</p>

<p>Let us for the moment accept the truth of the various
traditions relating to them, and suppose that they left traces of
their worship; what, in the light of the last chapter, should we
expect to find? The thing most likely to remain would be
ancient shrines in all probability serving for the foundation of
nobler structures built in later times.</p>

<p>This brings us to the question as to the probabilities of
temple-building generally in relation to the heavenly bodies;
but before I deal with it, it is important to consider a view
first put forward, I believe, by Vitruvius, and repeated by all
since his time who have dealt with the question, that the
temples were built purely and simply to face the Nile.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The statement is so far from the truth that it is clear that
those who have made it had not studied the larger temple-fields.
Indeed, we have only to note the conditions at Karnak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"> 59</span>
alone to determine whether there is any truth in the view that
the temples face the river. We see at once that this idea
cannot be true, because we have the chief temples facing in
four directions, while the Nile flows only on one side.</p>

<p>Other archæologists who have endeavoured to investigate the
orientations of these buildings have found that they practically
face in all directions; the statement is that their arrangement
is principally characterised by the want of it; they have been
put down higgledy-piggledy; there has been a symmetrophobia,
mitigated perhaps by a general desire that the temple should
face the Nile. This view might be the true one, if stars were
not observed as well as the sun.</p>

<p>With regard to all the temples of the ancient world, whether
they are located in Egypt or elsewhere, we must never forget
that if astronomy is concerned in them at all, we have to
deal with the observations of the rising or setting of the
heavenly bodies; whereas the modern astronomer cares little
for these risings or settings, but deals only with them on
the meridian.</p>

<p>The place of rising or setting would be connected with the
temple by the direction of the temple's axis.</p>

<p>Now, the directions towards which the temples point are
astronomically expressed by their "amplitudes"&mdash;that is, the
distance in degrees from the east or west point of the horizon.
For instance, a temple facing east would have an amplitude of
zero from the east point. If we suppose a temple oriented to
the north, it would have an amplitude of 90°; if half-way
between the east and north, the amplitude would be 45° north
of east, and so on. So that it is possible to express the
amplitude of a temple in such a way that the temples in the
same or different countries or localities, with the same or
equivalent amplitudes, may be classified; and the more temples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60"> 60</span>
which can be thus brought together, the more likely is any law
relating to their structure to come out.</p>

<p>Let us take this, then, as a general principle. Now how
would it be carried out?</p>

<p>It becomes pretty obvious, when we consider the conditions
of things in these early times, that the stars would be the
objects which would first commend themselves to the attention
of temple builders, for the reason that the movements and
rising-and setting-places of the various planets by night,
and of the sun by day, would appear to be so erratic, so long
as the order of their movements was not known.</p>

<p>To go a step further. It is clear in the first place that no
one would think of orienting a temple to the moon, as there is
so little constancy about its path in the sky, and, therefore, in
its place of rising or setting. If the temple caught it each
month, the intervals between which this occurrence takes place
would vary very considerably, and in early times would have
been impossible to predict. Similarly it would not be worth
while to orient temples to the planets. But when we come to
the stars, the thing is different. A few years' observations
would have appeared to demonstrate the absolute changelessness
of the places of rising and setting of the same stars.
It is true that this result would have been found to be erroneous
when a long period of time had elapsed and when
observation became more accurate; but for hundreds of years
the stars would certainly appear to represent fixity, while the
movements of sun, moon and planets would seem to be bound
by no law.</p>

<p>Before, then, the yearly apparent movements of the sun
had been fully made out, observations of a star rising or
setting <i>with the sun</i> at some critical time of the agricultural
cycle, say sowing-time or harvest, would be of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61"> 61</span>
importance, and would secure the work being done at the right
time of the&mdash;to the early peoples&mdash;still unformulated year.</p>

<p>If a star was chosen in or near the ecliptic, sooner or later
the sunlight as well as the starlight would enter the temple,
and the use of a solar temple might have thus been suggested
even before the solstices or equinoxes had been thoroughly
grasped.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if we are justified in assuming that
the stars were first observed, the next thing that would strike
the early astronomers would be the regularity of the annual
movement of the sun; the critical times of the sun's movements
as related either to their agriculture, or their festivals, or
to the year; the equinoxes and the solstices, would soon have
revealed themselves to these early observers, if for no other
reason than that they were connected in some way or other
with some of the important conditions of their environment.</p>

<p>After a certain time, solar temples, if built at all, would
be oriented either to the sun at some critical time of the
agricultural&mdash;or religious&mdash;year, or to the solstices and equinoxes.
But at first, until the fixity of the sun's yearly
movements and especially the solstices and equinoxes had
been recognised, it would have seemed as useless to direct a
temple to the sun as to the moon. After a time, however,
when the solstices and equinoxes had been made out, it would
soon have been found that a temple once directed to the
sun's rising place at harvest or sowing time, or at a solstice
or an equinox, would continue for a long period to mark those
critical points in the sun's yearly course; and when this yearly
course had been finally made out it would soon be observed
that the sun at any part of the agricultural year was as
constant (indeed, as we now know, more constant) in its
rising-and setting-place as a star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62"> 62</span></p>

<p>But dealing with <i>sun</i>-worshippers, and endeavouring to
think out what the earliest observers probably would try to do
in the case of a <i>solar</i> temple, we see that, in all likelihood, they
would orient it to observe the sun at one of the chief points in
the year which could be best marked. I have said "which
could be best marked," but how was this to be done? Evidently,
if terrestrial things were to be assisted, the marking
must have been by something exterrestrial, otherwise they
would have been reasoning in a circle; and moreover we
must take for granted that what was wanted was a warning
of what was to be done.</p>

<p>Now, in the earliest times, as I have said, the constant movements
of the stars would have stood out in strong contrast
to the inconstant movements of the sun, and I think that there
can be little doubt that the first fixing of any point in the
year was by the rising or setting of some star at sunrise&mdash;or
possibly sunset.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this might have gone on even before
the solstices and equinoxes were recognised.</p>

<p>When this came about, then temples might have been
directed to the sun at a solstice or an equinox.</p>

<p>Was it difficult to do this? Did it indicate that the people
who built such temples were great astronomers? Nothing of
the kind; nothing is more easy to determine than a solstice
or an equinox.</p>

<p>Let us take the solstice first. We know that at the summer
solstice the sun rises and sets furthest to the north, at the
winter solstice furthest to the south. We have only from any
point to set up a line of stakes before the time of the solstice,
and then alter the line of them day by day as the sun gets
further to the north or south, until no alteration is wanted.
The solstice has been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63"> 63</span></p>

<p>There is another way of doing it. Take a vertical rod.
Such a rod, which I may state is sometimes called a <i>gnomon</i> and
used to measure time, may be used with another object: we
may observe the length of the shadow cast by the sun when it
is lowest at the winter solstice, and when it is highest; at these
two positions of the sun obviously the lengths of the shadows
thrown will be different. When the noon-sun is nearest overhead
in the summer the length of the shadow will be least, when the
sun is most removed from the zenith the shadow will be longest.</p>

<p>The day on which the shortest shadow is thrown at noon
will define the summer solstice; when the shadow is longest we
shall have the winter solstice.</p>

<p>This, in fact, was the method adopted by the Chinese to
determine the solstices, and from it very early they found a
value of the obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>It may be said that this is only a statement, and that the
record has been falsified; some years ago anyone who was
driven by facts to come to the conclusion that any very
considerable antiquity was possible in these observations met
with very great difficulty. But the shortest and the longest
shadows recorded (1100 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) do not really represent the
true lengths at present. If anyone had forged these observations
he would state such lengths as people would find to-day
or to-morrow, but the lengths given were different from those
which would be found to-day. Laplace, who gave considerable
attention to this matter, determined what the real obliquity was at
that time, and proved that the record does represent an actual
observation, and not one which had been made in later years.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Next suppose an ancient Egyptian wished to determine the
time of an equinox. We know from the Egyptian tombs
that their stock-in-trade, so far as building went, was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64"> 64</span>
considerable; they had squares, they had plumb-lines, they had
scales, and all that sort of thing, just as we have. He would
first of all make a platform quite flat; he could do that by
means of the square or plumb-line; then he would get a ruler
with pretty sharp edges (and such rulers are found in their
tombs), and in the morning of any day he would direct this
ruler to the position of the sun when it was rising, and he would
from a given point draw a line towards the sun; he would do
the same thing in the evening when the sun set; he would
bisect the angle made by these two lines, and it would give
him naturally a north and south line, and a right angle
to this would give him east and west. So that from
observations of the sun on any one day in the year he would
practically be in a position to determine the points at which
the sun would rise and set at the equinox&mdash;that is, the true
east and west points.</p>

<p>Suppose that the sun is rising, let a rod throw a shadow;
mark the position of the shadow; at sunset we again note
where the shadow falls. If the sun rises exactly in the east
and sets exactly in the west, those two shadows will be
continuous, and we shall have made an observation at the
absolute equinox. But suppose the sun not at the equinox, a
line joining the ends of the shadows equally long before and
after noon will be an east and west line.</p>

<p>It is true that there may be a slight error unless we are
very careful about the time of the year at which we make the
observations, because when the sun is exactly east or west at
the time of rising or setting it changes its declination most
quickly. So it is better to make the above observations of
the sun nearer the solstices than the equinoxes, for the
reason stated.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"> 65</span></p>

<p>We have now got so far. If the Egyptians worshipped
the sun and built temples to it, they would be more likely
to choose the times of the solstices and the equinoxes than any
other after its annual movement had been made out.</p>

<p>Is it possible to bring any tests to bear to see whether
they did this or not? Certainly: examine the temples which
still remain, and where they have disappeared examine the
<i>temenos</i> walls which still exist as mounds in many cases.</p>

<p>Suppose we take, to begin with, as before, that region of
the earth's surface in the Nile valley with a latitude of about
26° N. The temples will have an amplitude of about 26° N. or S.
if they have anything to do with the sun at the solstices.
Any structures built to observe the sun will have an east
and west aspect true if they have anything to do with the sun
at the equinoxes. Dealing with a solstitial temple, the first
thing to observe is the amplitude of the temple, which must
depend upon the latitude in which it was wished to note the
rising or setting of the sun at either of the solstices. If we take
the latitude 26° N., which is very nearly the latitude of
Thebes, the amplitude has to be 26° as stated above; so that
a temple at Thebes having an amplitude of 26° would be very
likely to have been oriented to the sun at the moment that
it was as far from the equator as it could be&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, at the
time of the longest day of the year&mdash;in which case we
should be dealing with the summer or northern solstice; or
of the shortest day of the year, if dealing with the winter or
southern solstice.</p>

<p>As we deal with higher latitudes, we gradually increase the
amplitude, until, if we go as far as the latitude of the North
Cape, the sun at the summer solstice, as everybody knows,
has no amplitude either at rising or setting, because it passes
clear above the horizon altogether, and is seen at midnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66"> 66</span></p>

<p>These are the conditions which will define for us a
solstitial solar temple. We see the amplitude of the temple
must vary with the latitude of the place where it is erected.</p>

<p>But the temples directed to the sun at an equinox will
be directed to an amplitude of 0: that is, they will point
E. or W., and this will be the case in all latitudes.</p>

<p>The orientation of a temple directed to the sun at neither
the solstices nor the equinoxes will have an amplitude less than
the solstitial amplitude at the place.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, as I shall show in the sequel, some
of the temples recognised as temples of the sun in the inscriptions
are of this latter class.</p>

<small>METHODS OF DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF TEMPLES.</small></h2></div>


<p>This brings us at once to a practical point. It will be
asked, How can such an inquiry be prosecuted? How can
the amplitudes of the temples be determined?</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing is easier. An azimuth compass is all that is
necessary for all but the most accurate inquiries.</p>

</div>


<p>The azimuth compass is an instrument familiar to many;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68"> 68</span>
it consists of a magnetic needle fastened to a card carrying
a circle divided into 360°, which can be conveniently read
by a prism when the instrument is turned toward any definite
direction marked by a vertical wire. Its use depends upon the
fact that at the same place and at the same time all magnetic
needles point in the same direction, and the variation for
the true north and south direction is either supposed to be
known or can be found by observation.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p068" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p068.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THEODOLITE FOR DETERMINING AZIMUTH AND ALTITUDES.</div>
</div>

<p>A theodolite armed with a delicately hung magnetic needle,
which can be rotated on a vertical axis, will do still better;
it has first of all to be levelled. There is a little telescope
with which we can see along the line. When we wish, for
instance, to observe the amplitude of a temple, the theodolite
is set up on its tripod in such a position that we can look
along a temple wall or line of columns, etc., by means of
the telescope. We then get a magnetic reading of the
direction after having unclamped the compass; this gives
the angle made between the line and the magnetic north (or
south), as in the azimuth compass.</p>

<p>What we really do by means of such an instrument is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69"> 69</span>
determine the astronomical meridian by means of a magnetic
meridian. Here some definitions will not be out of place.</p>

<p>The <i>meridian</i> (<i>meridies</i> = midday) of any place is the great
circle of the heavens which passes through the zenith (the
point overhead) at that place and the poles of the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>The <i>meridian line</i> at any place is the intersection of the
plane of the meridian with the plane of the horizon at that
place, or, in other words, it is the line joining the north and
south points. If we have the proper instruments, we can
determine the meridian line astronomically at any place by
one of the following methods:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) If only an approximate position is required, the best
means of determining it is by fixing the direction of the sun or
a star when it has the greatest altitude. The instrument to be
used for this purpose would be a small theodolite with both a
vertical and horizontal circle, and provided also with tangent
screws to give slow motion to each of the circles as required.</p>

<p>By using stars of both high and low altitudes, a greater
exactness can be obtained, but, after all, the method only gives
a first approximation, as its weakness lies in the very slow
change of altitude as the meridian is approached.</p>

<p>(2) A much more accurate method is that of observing with
an altitude and azimuth instrument the azimuth (<i>i.e.</i>, its angular
distance east or west of the north or south) of a star when
at the same altitude east and west of the meridian. If the
mean of the two readings given by the azimuth circle be taken,
the resulting reading indicates the direction of the meridian.</p>

<p>If we employ the sun in place of a star, its change of
declination during the interval between the observations must
be taken into account.</p>

<p>(3) To find the meridian line by means of the pole star is a
simple and accurate method, as a value can be obtained at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70"> 70</span>
<i>any</i> time at night by a simple altitude, provided the time of
observation is known.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If these means of directly determining the astronomical
meridian line are not available, then we have to do it indirectly
by using the magnetic meridian in the first instance.</p>

<p>If we take a magnetic needle and balance it horizontally on
a vertical pivot, its ends will be directed to two points on the
horizon. By drawing a great circle through these two points
and the zenith point of the place, we obtain the <i>magnetic meridian</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>magnetic meridian line</i> is the intersection of the plane of
the magnetic meridian with the plane of the horizon. The
angle between the astronomical and magnetic meridian lines is
called the variation, E. or W. according as the needle points to
the W. or E. of true&mdash;that is, astronomical&mdash;north at any
particular place at any particular time. The variation may
vary from place to place, and always varies from time to time.</p>

<p>The bearing required has, in the first instance, to be determined
by the instruments already referred to in relation to
the magnetic meridian.</p>

<p>Having made such an observation, the next thing we
have to do is to determine the astronomical or true north,
which is the only thing of value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71"> 71</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p071" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p071.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MAGNETIC MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES, SHOWING THE VARIATION AT
DIFFERENT POINTS.</div>
</div>

<p>If the magnetic variation has been determined for the
region, we may use a map. Such a map as that shown
below gives us the lines along which in the British Isles
the compass variation west of north reaches certain values.
From such a map for Egypt we learn that in 1798 a magnet
swung along a line extending from a little to the west of
Cairo to the second cataract would have had a variation of
11½° to the west; in 1844 of 8½° to the west; and at the
present time the variation is such that observations made
along the same part of the Nile valley will have a variation
closely approximating 4½° to the west. By means of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72"> 72</span>
map it is quite possible to get approximately the astronomical
bearings of all temples which were observed by the French
in 1798 or by the Germans in 1844, or which can be observed
in the present day, provided always that there is no local
magnetic attraction.</p>

<p>If we are not fortunate enough to possess such a map, the
methods previously referred to for obtaining the astronomical
north must be employed; observing the direction in which
the sun culminates at noon will give us the south point
astronomically; from observations of the pole star at night the
astronomical north can also be determined. From the former
of these observations the magnetic variation is obtained without
any difficulty, even in the absence of accurate local time.
When this is available other methods are applicable.</p>

<p>It is sad to think how much time is lost in the investigation
of a great many of these questions for the reason that the
published observations were made only with reference to the
magnetic north, which is vastly different at different places,
and is always varying. Few indeed have tried to get at the
astronomical conditions of the problem. Had this been done
with minute accuracy in all cases, either by the French or
Prussian Commissions to which I have referred, it is perfectly
certain that the solstitial orientation of Karnak and other
temples, which I shall have to mention, would have been
long ago known to all scholars.</p>

previous chapter be prosecuted&mdash;<i>it has been prosecuted</i>.</p>

<p>The French and Prussian Governments have vied with
each other in the honourable rivalry of mapping and describing
the monuments. The French went to Egypt at the
end of the last century, while the Scientific Commission which
accompanied the army, a Commission appointed by the
Institute of France, published a series of volumes containing
plans of all the chief temples in the valley of the Nile as
far south as Philæ.</p>

<p>In the year 1844, some time after Champollion had led
the way in deciphering the hieroglyphics, we became almost
equally indebted to the Prussian Government, who also sent
out a Commission to Egypt, under Lepsius, which equalled
the French one in the importance of the results of the explorations;
in the care with which the observations were made,
and in the perfection with which they were recorded. In
attempting to get information from ancient temples on the
points to which I have referred, there is, therefore, a large
amount of information available; and it is wise to study
the region round and below Thebes where the information
is so abundant and is ready to our hand.</p>

<p>First, then, with regard to the existence of solar
temples. Dealing with the monumental evidence, the answer
is absolutely overwhelming. The evidence I bring forward
consists of that afforded by some of the very oldest temples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74"> 74</span>
that we know of in Egypt. Among the most ancient and
sacred fanes was one at Annu, On, or Heliopolis, which, the
tradition runs, was founded by the Shesu-Hor before the time
of Mena; Mena, as we have seen, having reigned at a date
certainly not less than 4000, and possibly 5000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF THE MOUNDS AT ABYDOS.<br />
(<i>From Mariette.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The Nile valley holds other solar temples besides that we
have named at Heliopolis. Abydos was another of the holiest
places in Egypt in the very earliest times.</p>

<p>Since the temples and temple mounds at Abydos can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75"> 75</span>
better made out than those at Heliopolis, I will take them
first. The orientations given by different authors are so
conflicting that no certainty can be claimed, but it is
possible that at Abydos one of the mounds is not far from
the amplitude shown in the tables for the sun in the Nile
valley at sunset at the summer solstice. If this were so, the
Egyptians who were employed in building the temple must
have known exactly what they were going to do.</p>

<p>At Heliopolis, as I have hinted, the matter is still less certain.
Almost every trace of the temple has disappeared, but of
remains of temenos walls in 1844, when the site was studied by
Lepsius, there were plenty. At Karnak, where both temples
and temenos walls remain, we can see how closely the walls
reflect the orientation of the included temples, even when they
seem most liable to the suggestion of symmetrophobia. I have
before stated that the Egyptians have been accused of hating
every regular figure, and the irregular figures at Karnak are
very remarkable; in the boundary walls of the temple of Amen-Rā
there are two obtuse angles; round the Mut temple we also
have walls, and there again this hatred of similarity seems to
come out, for we have one obtuse and one acute angle. But if
we examine the thing a little carefully, we find that there
is a good deal of method in this apparent irregularity. The
wall of the temple of Amen-Rā is parallel to the face of the
temple or at right angles to its length. One wall of Mut is
perfectly parallel to the face of the temple or at right angles to
the sphinxes. And the reason that we do not get right angles at
one end of the wall is that the walls of the temple at Mut are
parallel to the chief wall of the temple of Amen-Rā. Surely it
must be that, before these walls were built, it was understood
that there was a combined worship; that they stood or fell
together. One thing was not attempted in one temple and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76"> 76</span>
another thing in another, but the worship of each was reflected
in the other. If this be true, there was no hatred of symmetry,
but a definite and admirable reason why these walls should be
built as they were.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p076" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p076.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE MOUNDS AND OBELISK AT ANNU.</div>
</div>

<p>With the knowledge we possess of both temenos walls and
temples at Karnak, and of the, I may almost say, symbolism of
the former, it is fair to conclude that when temples have gone
we may yet get help from the walls. The walls at Heliopolis
are the most extraordinary I have met with in Egypt, as may
be gathered from the accompanying reduction of Lepsius' map.</p>

<p>The arrow in Lepsius' plan is so wrongly placed that the
plan is very misleading. It follows from Captain Lyons' observations
and my own that the longest mound heads 14° N. of W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77"> 77</span>
to 14° S. of E. within a degree; the condition of the mounds
renders more accurate measures impossible.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is to be gathered from the inscriptions that the temple
within these mounds, now only represented by its solitary
obelisk, was styled a sanctuary or temple of the sun.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As the orientation of the N. and S. faces of the obelisk is
13° N. of W., the sun's declination must have been 11° N.
The times of our year marked by it, therefore, were 18th April
and 24th August. But it must not be forgotten that the
temple may have been built originally to watch the rising or
setting of a star which occupied the declination named, and
possibly, though not necessarily, at some other time of the
year. I shall return to this subject.</p>

<p>If Maspero and the great authorities in Egyptology are
right&mdash;namely, that the Annu temple was founded before 4000
B.C.&mdash;the above figures drive us to the conclusion that we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78"> 78</span>
in this temple a building which was orientated to the sun, <i>not</i>
at a solstice, some 6000 years ago.</p>

<p>So much for two of the places known to be of the highest
antiquity in Egypt. There remains another locality supposed
to date from more modern times&mdash;I refer to Thebes. It is here
that evidence of the most certain kind with regard to the
solstitial temples is to be found.</p>

<p>At Karnak itself there are several temples so oriented, chief
among them the magnificent Temple of Amen-Rā, one of the
wonders of the world, to which a special chapter must be devoted.
Suffice it to say here that the amplitude of the point to which
the axis of the great temple of Amen-Rā points is 26° N. of W.,
which we learn from the table already given is the amplitude
of the place of sunset at the summer solstice in the latitude of
Thebes. The amplitude of the point to which the axis of an
attached small temple points is 26° S. of E., exactly the position
of sunrise at the winter solstice.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten in this connection that the Colossi
of the plain on the other side of the river, and the associated
temple, also face the place of sunrise at the winter solstice.</p>

<p>The list of solar solstitial temples, so far probably traced, is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>We have seen that it did not require any great amount of
astronomical knowledge to determine either the moment of the
solstice or the moment of the equinox. The most natural thing
to begin with was the observation of the solstice, for the reason
that at the solstice the sun can be watched day after day getting
more and more north or more and more south until it comes to
a standstill. But for the observation of the equinox, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81"> 81</span>
the sun is moving-most rapidly either north or south, and
therefore it would be more difficult to determine in those
days the exact moment.</p>

  <div class="caption">EAST AND WEST PYRAMIDS AND TEMPLES AT GÎZEH.<br />
 (<i>From Lepsius.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>We next come to the question as to whether any buildings
were erected from an equinoctial point of view&mdash;that is,
buildings oriented east and west.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable than to go from the description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82"> 82</span>
and the plans of such temples as we have seen at Abydos, Annu,
and Karnak, to regions where, apparently, the thought is totally
and completely different, such as we find on the Pyramid
Plains at Gîzeh, at Memphis, Tunis, Saïs, and Bubastis.
The orientation lines of the German surveyors show beyond
all question that the pyramids and some of the temenos walls
at the places named are
just as true to the sun-rising
at the equinoxes
as the temples referred
to at Karnak were to the
sun-rising and setting at
the solstices, and the
Sphinx was merely a
mysterious nondescript
sort of thing which was
there watching for the
rising of the sun at an
equinox, as the Colossi
of the plain at Thebes were watching for the rising of the sun
at the winter solstice.</p>

  <div class="caption">TEMPLE AND TEMENOS WALLS OF SAÏS (SĀ-EL-LAGER).<br />

</div>

<p>Further, the temples at Gîzeh, instead of being oriented to
the north-west, and to the south-east, are just as truly oriented
to the east and west as the Pyramids themselves. We have
either Temples of Osiris pointing to the sunset at the equinox,
or temples of Isis pointing to the sunrise at the equinox, but in
either case built in relation to the Pyramids. As an indication
of the importance of the considerations with which we are now
dealing, I may mention that it is suggested by them that the
building near the Sphinx is really a crypt of a temple of Isis
or Osiris. This is a view which may change the ideas generally
held with regard to its age to the extent of something like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83"> 83</span>
thousand years. It has been imagined that it was at least one
thousand years older than the second Pyramid; but if it be
ultimately proved that this is really a temple of Isis or Osiris,
then since it was built in just as strict relation to the side
of the Pyramid as the temple near the Pyramid was to its centre,
both temples were most probably built at the same time as the
Pyramid itself. However this may be, the important thing
is that when we pass from Thebes, and possibly Abydos, to
the Pyramids at Memphis, to Saïs and Tanis, we find a
solstitial orientation changed to an equinoctial one. <i>There is
a fundamental change of astronomical thought.</i></p>

</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"> 85</span></p>

<p>I confess I am impressed by this distinction; from the
astronomical point of view it is so fundamental that almost
a difference of race is required to explain it. I say this advisedly,
although I know creed can go a great way, because
among these early peoples their astronomy was chiefly a means
to an end. It was not a story of abstract conceptions, or the
mere expression of interesting facts whether used for religious
purposes or not. The end was a calendar, of festivals and
holydays if you will, but a calendar which would allow their
tillage and harvest to prosper.</p>

<p>Now, it is almost impossible to suppose that those who
worshipped the sun at the solstice did not begin the year at the
solstice. It is, of course, equally difficult to believe that those
who preferred to range themselves as equinoctials did not begin
the year at an equinox. Both these practices could hardly go
on in the case of the same race in the same country, least of all
in the valley where an annual inundation marked the
solstice.</p>

<p>I shall show subsequently how the rise of the Nile, which
took place at the summer solstice, not only dominated the
industry, but the astronomy and religion of Egypt; and I was
much interested in hearing from my friend Dr. Wallis Budge
that the rise of the Tigris and Euphrates takes place not far
from the spring equinox. This may have dominated the
Babylonian calendar as effectually as the date of the Nile-rise
dominated the Egyptian. If so, we have a valuable hint as to
the origin of the equinoctial cult at Gîzeh and elsewhere,
which in all probability was interpolated after the non-equinoctial
worship had been first founded at Annu, Abydos,
and possibly Thebes.</p>

<p>The observations which have been made in Babylonia are
very discordant among themselves, and at present it is impossible
to say, from the monuments in any part of the region
along the Tigris valley, whether the temples indicate that the
solstices were familiar to the Babylonians.</p>

the modern names of the sites are as follows:</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the region in the valley near where
the Upper Zab joins the main stream. We gather from the
map published in 1867 by Place,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that Nimrûd, the modern
Calah, is near the junction, while the mounds of Kouyunjik,
Mosul, and Khorsabad, representing the ancient Dur Sarginu,
are to the north (36° N. latitude). There are two other
mounds shown on the map at Djigan and Tel Hakoab.</p>

<p>Now, by inspection it is quite clear that none of the mounds
except that of Nimrûd lie east and west. It becomes important,
therefore, to determine their orientation; but, alas! this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"> 87</span>
nearly impossible with the sole exception of Khorsabad, for no
measures appear to have been made.</p>

<p>At first sight the matter seems more hopeful in the case of
Khorsabad, for we have not only the plans of Place, but those
of Botta and Flandin.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The plans seem oriented with care, so
far as the existence of a compass direction is concerned&mdash;for
that is present while it too often is lacking in such productions&mdash;but
in neither series is it stated whether N. means
true or magnetic north.</p>

<p>Both observers noted a well-marked temple facing N.E.,
and also an "observatory." About the temple there can be
no mistake, for the fair-way of the light to it is carefully
preserved, and there is a flight of wide steps on the north-east
side of it.</p>

<p>Place gives the orientation 37° N. of E. in one plan and
39° in another. Botta and Flandin give 31½° in one plan and
32° in another! Now, the change in the magnetic variation
between 1849 and 1867 will not explain this difference, nor
indeed can it be accounted for by supposing that the magnetic
north is in question in one set of plans and the true north in
the other;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and it is clear that no perfectly certain conclusion
can be arrived at till this work has been done over again. But
it is known that M. Flandin was a skilled surveyor, and we
have the remarkable fact, that if we take his value, <i>we have the
amplitude of the sun at the summer solstice in the latitude of
Nineveh</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88"> 88</span></p>

<p>I certainly think the temple may be accepted as a solstitial
solar temple provisionally; and if so, the question is raised
whether the structures in Assyria, supposed to be oriented so
that the <i>angles</i> face the cardinal points, are not all of them
oriented to the sun at a solstice or to some other heavenly
body. Certainly we must have more definite measures before
the statement generally made can be accepted as final.</p>

<p>When we leave Assyria we find other countries, it is true
still farther afield, in which the existence of solstitial temples
of a great antiquity of foundation is fully recognised.</p>

<p>The great temple of the sun at Pekin is oriented to the
winter solstice. The ceremonials which take place there are
thus described by Edkins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The most important of all the State observances of China is the sacrifice at
the winter solstice, performed in the open air at the south altar of the Temple
of Heaven, December 21st. The altar is called Nan-Tan, 'south mound,' or
Yuenkieu, 'round hillock'&mdash;both names of the greatest antiquity.</p>

<p>"Here also are offered prayers for rain in the early summer. The altar is
a beautiful marble structure, ascended by twenty-seven steps, and ornamented
by circular balustrades on each of its three terraces. There is another on the
north side of somewhat smaller dimensions, called the Ch'i-ku-t'an, or altar for
prayer on behalf of grain. On it is raised a magnificent triple-roofed circular
structure 99 feet in height, which constitutes the most conspicuous object
in the <i>tout ensemble</i>, and is that which is called by foreigners the Temple of
Heaven. It is the hall of prayer for a propitious year, and here, early in the
spring, the prayer and sacrifice for that object are prosecuted. These structures
are deeply enshrined in a thick cypress grove, reminding the visitor of the
custom which formerly prevailed among the heathen nations of the Old Testament,
and of the solemn shade which surrounded some celebrated temples of
ancient Greece."</p>
</div>

<p>The Temple of Heaven is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The south altar, the most important of all Chinese religious structures,
has the following dimensions: It consists of a triple circular terrace, 210
feet wide at the base, 150 in the middle, and 90 at the top. In these,
notice the multiples of three: 3 × 3 = 9, 3 × 5 = 15, 3 × 7 = 21. The
heights of the three terraces, upper, middle, and lower, are 5·72 feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89"> 89</span>
6·23 feet, and 5 feet respectively. At the times of sacrificing, the tablets
to heaven and to the Emperor's ancestors are placed on the top; they
are 2 feet 5 inches long, and 5 inches wide. The title is in gilt letters;
that of heaven faces the south, and those of the ancestors east and
west. The Emperor, with his immediate suite, kneels in front of the
tablet of Shang-Ti and faces the north. The platform is laid with marble
stones, forming nine concentric circles; the inner circle consists of nine
stones, cut so as to fit with close edges round the central stone, which
is a perfect circle. Here the Emperor kneels, and is surrounded first by
the circles of the terraces and their enclosing walls, and then by the
circle of the horizon. He thus seems to himself and his court to be in
the centre of the universe, and turning to the north, assuming the attitude
of a subject, he acknowledges in prayer and by his position that he is
inferior to heaven, and to heaven alone. Round him on the pavement are
the nine circles of as many heavens, consisting of nine stones, then eighteen,
then twenty-seven, and so on in successive multiples of nine till the square
of nine, the favourite number of Chinese philosophy, is reached in the
outermost circle of eighty-one stones.</p>

<p>"The same symbolism is carried throughout the balustrades, the steps,
and the two lower terraces of the altar. Four flights of steps of nine
each lead down to the middle terrace, where are placed the tablets to
the spirits of the sun, moon, and stars and the year god, Tai-sui. The
sun and stars take the east, and the moon and Tai-sui the west: the
stars are the twenty-eight constellations of the Chinese zodiac, borrowed
by the Hindoos soon after the Christian era, and called by them the
Naksha-tras; the Tai-sui is a deification of the sixty-year cycle."<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We find, then, that, the most important temple in China
is oriented to the winter solstice.</p>

<p>To mention another instance. It has long been known that
Stonehenge is oriented to the rising of the sun at, the summer
solstice. Its amplitude instead of being 26° is 40° N. of E.;
with a latitude of 51°, the 26° azimuth of Thebes is represented
by an amplitude of 40° at Stonehenge.</p>

<p>The structure consists of a double circle of stones, with
a sort of naos composed of large stones facing a so-called
avenue, which is a sunken way between two parallel banks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90"> 90</span>
This avenue stretches away from the naos in the direction
of the solstitial sunrise.</p>

<p>But this is not all. In the avenue, but not in the centre
of its width, there is a stone called the "Friar's Heel," so
located in relation to the horizon that, according to Mr.
Flinders Petrie,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who has made careful measurements of the
whole structure, it aligned the coming sunrise from a point
behind the naos or trilithon. The horizon is invisible at the
entrance of the circle, the peak of the heel rising far above
it; from behind the circles the peak is below the horizon.
Now, from considerations which I shall state at length further
on, Mr. Petrie concludes that Stonehenge existed 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>
It must not be forgotten that structures more or less similar
to Stonehenge are found along a line from the east on both
sides of the Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p090" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p090.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">STONEHENGE, FROM THE NORTH.</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the use of the marking stone to indicate
the direction in which the sun will rise answers exactly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91"> 91</span>
same purpose as the long avenue of majestic columns and
pylons in the Egyptian temples. In both cases we had a
means of determining the commencement and the succession
of years.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p091.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"> STONEHENGE RESTORED.</div>
</div>

<p>Hence, just as surely as the temple of Karnak once pointed
to the sun <i>setting</i> at the summer solstice, the temple at Stonehenge
pointed nearly to the sun <i>rising</i> at the summer solstice.
Stonehenge, there is little doubt, was so constructed that at
sunrise at the same solstice the shadow of one stone fell exactly
on the stone in the centre; that observation indicated to the
priests that the New Year had begun, and possibly also fires
were lighted to flash the news through the country. And in
this way it is possible that we have the ultimate origin of
the midsummer fires, which have been referred to by so many
authors.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>We have thus considered solstitial temples scattered widely
over the earth's surface far from the Nile Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92"> 92</span></p>

<p>We may now return to the equinoctial temples which can
still be traced to the N.E. of that valley&mdash;the chief ones being
those, remains of which still exist at Jerusalem, Baalbek, and
Palmyra, where stone was available for the temple builders.
These temples were apparently as perfectly squared to the
equinox as the Pyramids at Gîzeh. I will take the temple of
Jerusalem first, as its history is more complete than that of
the others.</p>

<p>We learn from the works of Josephus that as early as
Solomon's time the temple at Jerusalem was oriented to the
east with care;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in other words, the temple at Jerusalem was
parallel to the temple of Isis at the Pyramids; it was open to
the east, closed absolutely to the west. In plan, as we shall
see, it was very like an Egyptian temple, the light from the
sun at the equinox being free to come along an open passage,
and to get at last into the Holy of Holies. We find that the
direction of the axis of the temple shows the existence of a cult
connected with the possibility of seeing the sun rise at either
the spring or the autumn equinox.</p>

<p>All the doors being opened, the sunlight would penetrate
over the high altar, where the sacrifices were offered, into the
very Holy of Holies, which we may remember was only entered
by the high priest once a year; it could have done that twice
a year, but as a matter of fact it was only utilised once;
whereas at Karnak the priest would only go into the Holy of
Holies once a year, because it was only once illuminated by
the sun in each year.</p>

<p>There is evidence, too, that the entrance of the sunlight on
the morning of the spring equinox formed part of the ceremonial.
The priest being in the naos, the worshippers outside,
with their backs to the sun, could see the high priest by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93"> 93</span>
of the sunlight reflected from the jewels<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in his garments, thus
referred to by Josephus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I will now treat of what I before omitted&mdash;the garment of the high
priest, for he [Moses] left no room for the evil practices of [false] prophets;
but if some of that sort should attempt to abuse the Divine authority, he
left it to God to be present at His sacrifices when He pleased, and when He
pleased to be absent. And he was willing this should be known, not to
the Hebrews only, but to those foreigners also who were there. For as to
those stones, which we told you before, the high priest bare on his shoulders,
which were sardonyxes (and I think it needless to describe their feature,
they being known to everybody), <i>the one of them shined out when God
was present at their sacrifices</i>.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I mean that which was of the nature of
a button on his right shoulder, bright rays darting out thence, and being
seen even by those who were most remote; which splendour yet was not
before natural to the stone."</p>
</div>

<p>Josephus<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> states that the miraculous shining of the
jewels ceased two hundred years before his time, "God
having been displeased at the transgression of His laws."</p>

<p>This remark of Josephus quite justifies the assumption that
the effect of sunlight on the priest's jewels formed part of the
ceremonial, and in this way. In the earliest times there is
no doubt that the equinoctial temples were solar temples
pure and simple, and the rising sun would always, in fine
weather, shine into them at the equinox, which, while they
were used as solar temples, marked New Year's Day. The
influence of the later Babylonian astronomy, however, at
length replaced the sun by the moon, and the year would
commence, not at the equinox, but by a new or a full moon
near the equinox. If either of these happened <i>at</i> the equinox,
well and good; but if not, then the sun's declination might be
widely different from 0°&mdash;it might amount roughly to 10°
either N. or S.&mdash;and under these circumstances, as the amplitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94"> 94</span>
would be greater, the sun's light could not enter the temple at
all at the date of the feast. More than this, a mistake of a
month might be made, or a question of old style and new
style might come in, and that of course would make matters
worse. In this way, then, the withdrawal of the sunlight
from the temple at Jerusalem admits of being astronomically
explained.</p>

<p>It seems highly probable that the temple in question
was built on a Phenician foundation, for some of the stones
exceed 38 feet in length and weigh 90 tons.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This remark
is suggested by the fact that at Baalbek or Heliopolis, to
which I next direct attention, the most ancient and most
massive part of the structure is, in all probability, of Phenician
origin. To give an idea of its massiveness, which is almost
more than Egyptian, it may be stated that there are three
stones each about 64 feet long, 13 feet high, and 13 feet
thick. There are smaller stones used in the filling in, of
the same height and thickness, and 30 feet long.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> These
form the western wall of the original naos or of its support.</p>

<p>Here the orientation is due E.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> When we come to
Palmyra, we find also another temple to the equinoctial
sun; but here the sunset, and not the sunrise, is in question&mdash;the
temple faces due west.</p>

<p>In the whole problem, then, of orientation as I have had to
present it, and as it now stands, we seem for the moment to be
face to face with two very remarkable and strange things; so
strange that the argument may appear far-fetched and worthless,
since we are landed in a region apparently very far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95"> 95</span>
removed from our modern habits of thought. But is this
really so? I assume the personification or the deification of the
sun: I shall subsequently have to include the stars; I indicate
special orientations of buildings devoted to the worship of
the sun at one time of the year or another. But really both
these things, though they seem improbable, have been carried
down to our own day, quite independently of any question
relating to Egypt. There is nothing new about them at
all, and there is nothing really strange. When we go into an
observatory we think nothing of turning our telescope towards
Venus, or Jupiter, or Mars. Here we have the deification of
the planets. It is perfectly true that this religious treatment of
the planets is not of our own day: we have inherited it from
the Greeks through the Latins; but we do not think it at all
extraordinary that a planet should be called Venus or Jupiter.
Thus we of to-day are completely in touch with the old
Egyptians, except that the Egyptians were wiser in their
generation, and looked after the sun at fixed points in the year
and the constant stars instead of the variable planets.</p>

<p>Then, again, take the question of orientation. This is, after
all, one which survives among ourselves. All our churches are
more or less oriented, which is a remnant of old sun-worship.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Any church that is properly built to-day will have its axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96"> 96</span>
pointing to the rising of the sun on the Saint's Day, <i>i.e.</i>, a
church dedicated to St. John ought not to be parallel to a
church dedicated to St. Peter. It is true that there are sometimes
local conditions which prevent this; but if the architect
knows his business properly he is unhappy unless he can carry
out this old-world tradition. But it may be suggested that in
our churches the door is always to the west and the altar is
always to the east. That is perfectly true, but it is a modern
practice. Certainly in the early centuries the churches were
all oriented to the sun, so that the light fell on the altar through
the eastern doors at sunrise. The late Gilbert Scott, in his
"Essay on Church Architecture," gives a very detailed account
of these early churches, which in this respect exactly resembled
the Egyptian temples.</p>

<p>In regard to old St. Peter's at Rome,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> we read that "so
exactly due east and west was the Basilica that, on the vernal
equinox, the great doors of the porch of the quadriporticus were
thrown open at sunrise, and also the eastern doors of the church
itself, and as the sun rose, its rays passed through the outer
doors, then through the inner doors, and, penetrating straight
through the nave, illuminated the High Altar." The present
church fulfils the same conditions.</p>

<small>THE SOLAR TEMPLE OF AMEN-RĀ AT KARNAK.</small></h2></div>


<p>So much having been premised concerning the early temple-worship
of the sun in Egypt and the adjacent countries,
and the survival of some of the ideas connected with it
down to our own day, I next propose to describe the
finest Egyptian solar temple which remains open to our
examination&mdash;that of Amen-Rā at Karnak.</p>

<p>Of the chief solar temples referred to in a previous
chapter, two have passed away; even the orientation of the
one at Heliopolis I was only able to determine by the mounds,
assuming them to bear the same relation to the temple as other
mounds do, and the remaining obelisk.</p>

<p>The temple at Abydos is also a mound; but in the case of
the temple of Amen-Rā at Thebes the case is different: instead
of being a mere heap, the orientation of which is obtainable only
by the general lie of the remains, this temple is still in such
preservation that Lepsius in the year 1844 could give us a
large number of details about it, and locate the position of
the innumerable courts. Its orientation to the solstice we can
claim, as I hope to be able to show, as an early astronomical
observation. So it is quite fair to say that, many thousand
years ago at all events, the Egyptians were perfectly familiar
with the solstices, and therefore more or less fully with the
yearly path of the sun.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp40" id="i_p100" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <div class="caption">AXIS OF THE TEMPLE OF AMEN-RĀ FROM THE
WESTERN PYLON, LOOKING SOUTH-EAST.</div>
</div>

<p>This temple of Amen-Rā is beyond all question the most
majestic ruin in the world. There is a sort of stone avenue in
the centre, giving a view towards the north-west, and this axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100"> 100</span>
is something like five hundred yards in length. The whole object of the
builder of the great temple at Karnak&mdash;one of the most soul-stirring
temples which have ever been conceived or built by man&mdash;was to preserve
that axis absolutely open; and all the wonderful halls of columns and
the like, as seen on one side or other of the axis, are merely details;
the point being that the axis should be absolutely open, straight, and
true. The axis was directed towards the hills on the west side of the
Nile, in which are the tombs of the kings. From the external pylon the
South-eastern outlook through the ruins shows the whole length of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101"> 101</span>
the temple, and we see at the very extremity of the central
line a gateway nearly six hundred yards away. This belonged
to a temple pointing towards the south-east. There were
really two temples in the same line back to back, the chief one
facing the sunset at the summer solstice, the other probably the
sunrise at the winter solstice. The distance which separates
the outside entrances of both these temples is greater than
that from Pall Mall to Piccadilly; the great temple covers
about twice the area covered by St. Peter's at Rome, so that
the whole structure was of a vastness absolutely unapproached
in the modern ecclesiastical world.</p>

<p>Some Egyptian temples took many tens of years to build;
the obelisks, all in single blocks, were brought for hundreds of
miles down the Nile. The building of a solar temple like
that of Amen-Rā meant to the Egyptians a very serious undertaking
indeed.</p>

<p>Some of the structural details are of a very curious nature,
while the general arrangement of the temple itself is no less
extraordinary. First, with regard to the temple axis. It seems
to be a general rule that from the entrance-pylon the temple
stretches through various halls of different sizes and details,
until at last, at the extreme end, what is called the Sanctuary,
Naos, Adytum, or Holy of Holies, is reached. The end of the
temple at which the pylons are situated is open, the other is
closed. These lofty pylons, and even the walls, are sometimes
covered with the most wonderful drawings and hieroglyphic
figures and records. Stretching in front of the pylons,
extending sometimes very far in front, are rows of sphinxes.
This principle is carried to such an extent that in some cases
separate isolated gates have been built right in front and
exactly in the alignment of the temple.</p>

<p>From one end of the temple to the other we find the axis
marked out by narrow apertures in the various pylons, and
many walls with doors crossing the axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103"> 103</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p103" style="max-width: 93.75em;">

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p104.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">RUINS OF DOOR AT ENTRANCE OF THE SANCTUARY.</div>
</div>

<p>In the temple of Amen-Rā there are 17 or 18 of these
apertures, limiting the light which falls into the Holy of
Holies or the Sanctuary. This construction gives one a very
definite impression that every part of the temple was built to
subserve a special object, viz., to limit the light which fell on
its front into a narrow beam, and to carry it to the other
extremity of the temple&mdash;into the sanctuary, so that once a
year when the sun set at the solstice the light passed without
interruption along the whole length of the temple, finally
illuminating the Sanctuary in most resplendent fashion and
striking the Sanctuary wall. The wall of the Sanctuary
opposite to the entrance of the temple was always blocked.
There is no case in which the beam of light can pass absolutely
through the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105"> 105</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_p105" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption">THE OBELISKS NEAR THE OLDEST PART OF THE TEMPLE OF AMEN-RĀ AT
KARNAK.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106"> 106</span></p>
<p>The point was to provide an axis open at one end and
absolutely closed at the other, the open courts being only
found towards that end towards which the temple opened,
the other end being all but absolutely dark and quite blocked
up at the extremity.</p>

<p>These sunlight effects were fully appreciated. Referring to
the obelisks erected by Queen Hāt-shepset as a monument
to her father Amen, an inscription at the base of one of these
says, "They are seen an endless number of miles off: <i>it is a
flood of shining splendour when the sun shines between the two</i>;"<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and again, "The sun's disc shines between them as when it
rises from the horizon of heaven."<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Passing from the temple at Karnak to others in a better
state of preservation, we can gather that the part of the axis
furthest from the entrance was covered, so that in the <i>penetralia</i>
there was only a dim religious light. The entrance is also, as
it were, guarded by a massive exterior pylon, as in the more or
less modern temple of Edfû. This, again, reduces the light
in the interior.</p>

<p>It is easy to recognise that these arrangements bear out
the idea of an astronomical use of the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107"> 107</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_p107" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption">INNER COURT AND SANCTUARY AT EDFÛ.<br />
(<i>From a Photograph by the Author.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108"> 108</span></p>

<p>First of all we know that the temple was directed to the
place of the sun's setting; and if the Egyptians wished to lead
the narrow shaft of light which was bound to enter the temple,
since it was directed to the sunset, they would have contrived
the very system of gradually narrowing doors which we have
found to be one of the special features of the temple.</p>

<p>The doors were considered as very important&mdash;and no
wonder. In the account given of Thothmes III.'s restoration of
the temple of Amen-Rā, we read that after the building had been
constructed in a "position corresponding to the four quarters
of heaven" the great stone gateways were erected.</p>

<p>"The first had doors of real acacia wood covered with
plates of gold, fastened with black bronze and iron."</p>

<p>Then came a propylon (Bekhen) with three other gates
connected with it covered with plates of copper, and the
sacrifices were brought through these.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>This idea is strengthened by considering the construction of
the astronomical telescope. Although the Egyptians knew
nothing about telescopes, it would seem that they had the same
problem before them which we solve by a special arrangement
in the modern telescope&mdash;they wanted to keep the light pure,
and to lead it into their sanctuary as we lead it to the
eyepiece. To keep the light that passes into the eyepiece
of a modern telescope pure, we have between the object-glass
and the eyepiece a series of what are called diaphragms; that is,
a series of rings right along the tube, the inner diameters of
the rings being greatest close to the object-glass, and smallest
close to the eyepiece; these diaphragms must so be made that
all the light from the object-glass shall fall upon the eyepiece,
without loss or reflection by the tube.</p>

<p>These apertures in the pylons and separating walls of
Egyptian temples exactly represent the diaphragms in the
modern telescope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"> 109</span></p>

<p>What then was the real use of these pylons and these
diaphragms? It was to keep all stray light out of the
carefully roofed and darkened Sanctuary; but why was the
Sanctuary to be kept in darkness?</p>

<p>The first point that I wish to make is that these temples&mdash;whatever
view may be entertained with regard to their worship
or the ceremonial in them&mdash;were undoubtedly constructed
among other reasons for the purpose of obtaining an exact
observation of the precise time of the solstice. The priests
having this power at their disposal, would not be likely to
neglect it, for they ruled by knowledge. The temples were,
then, astronomical observatories, and the first observatories
that we know of in the world.</p>

<p>If we consider them as horizontal telescopes used for the
purpose I have suggested, we at once understand the long axis,
and the series of gradually narrowing diaphragms, for the
longer the beam of light used the greater is the accuracy that
can be obtained.</p>

<p>Independently of ceremonial reasons&mdash;there is a good deal
to be said under that head&mdash;it is quite clear that the darker the
sanctuary the more obvious will be the patch of light on the end
wall, and the more easily can its position be located. It was
important to do this on the two or three days near the solstice,
in order to get an idea of the exact time at which the solstice
took place. We find that a narrow beam of sunlight coming
through a narrow entrance some 500 yards away from the door
of the Holy of Holies would, provided the temple were
properly orientated to the solstice, and provided the solstice
occurred at the absolute moment of sunrise or sunset according
to which the temple was being utilised, practically flash into
the sanctuary and remain there for about a couple of minutes,
and then pass away. The flash would be a crescendo and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110"> 110</span>
diminuendo, but the whole thing would not last above two
minutes or thereabouts, and might be considerably reduced by an
arrangement of curtains. Supposing the solstice did not occur
at the precise moment of sunrise or sunset, and provided the
Egyptians by any means whatever were able to divide the days
and the nights into more or less equal intervals of time, two or
three observations of the sun rising at the solstice on three
different mornings, or of the sunset at the solstice on three
different evenings, would enable a careful observer to say
whether the solstice had occurred at the exact moment of
sunrise or sunset, or at some interval between two successive
sunrises or sunsets, and what that interval was.</p>

<p>We may conclude that there was some purpose of utility
to be served, and the solar temples could have been used
undoubtedly, among other things, for determining the exact
length of the solar year.</p>

<p>I now come to my next point, which is that here we have
the true origin of our present means of measuring time; that
our year as we know it was first determined in these Egyptian
temples and by the Egyptians. The magnificent burst of
the light at sunset into the sanctuary would show that a new
true solar year was beginning. It so happens that the summer
solstice was the time when the Nile began, and still begins, to
rise; so that in Egypt the priests were enabled to determine,
year after year, not only the length of the year, but the exact
time of its commencement. This, however, they apparently
kept to themselves, for the year in use, called the vague year,
began at different times of the true year through a long
cycle, as I shall show in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>If the Egyptians wished to use the temple for ceremonial
purposes, the magnificent beam of light thrown into the temple
at the sunset hour would give them opportunities and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111"> 111</span>
suggestions for so doing; for instance, they might place an image
of the god in the sanctuary and allow the light to Hash upon
it. We should have a "manifestation of Rā" with a vengeance
during the brief time the white flood of sunlight fell on it; be
it remembered that in the dry and clear air of Egypt the sun
casts a shadow five seconds after the first little point of it has
been seen above the horizon. So that at sunrise and sunset
in Egypt the light is very strong, and not tempered as with us.
They did this: we not only find the exact allocation of words
"the manifestation of Rā," but what happened is described.
One of the inscriptions relating to the manifestation of Rā has
been translated by De Rougé as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Il vint en passant vers le temple de Rā; il entra dans le temple en
adorant (deux fois). Le χer-heb [celebrant] invoqua (celui qui) repousse les
plaies du roi; il remplit les rites de la porte; il prit le seteb, il se purifia par
l'encens; il fit une libation; il apporta les fleurs de <i>Habenben</i> [a part of the
temple]; il apporta le parfum (?). Il monta les degrés vers l'adytum grand,
pour voir Rā dans Habenben; lui-même se tint seul; il poussa le verrou; il
ouvrit les portes; il vit son père Rā dans Habenben; il vénéra la barque de
Rā et la barque de Tum. Il tira les portes, et posa la terre sigillaire (qu'il)
scella avec le sceau du roi. Lui-même ordonne aux prêtres, 'J'ai placé le
sceau; que n'entre pas quelqu'un dedans de tout roi qui se tiendra (là).'"<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the quotation the apparatus of doors is referred to, and
it is not difficult to understand that by a particular arrangement
of them it would be easily possible to allow the hash which
lighted up the image of the god to be of very brief duration.
Remember that the sanctuary was dark, that the king stood
with his back to the pylon (and therefore to the sun). Under
these circumstances, to an excited imagination it would be the
god himself and not his image which appeared. Maspero<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
adduces much evidence to show that the priests were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112"> 112</span>
above pious frauds even in the worship connected with the
Holy of Holies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The shrines [in the sanctuary] are little chapels of wood or stone, in
which the spirit of the deity was supposed at all times to dwell, and which
on ceremonial occasions contained his image. The sacred barks were built
after the model of the Bari, or boat in which the sun performed his daily
course. The shrine was placed amidships of the boat and covered with a
veil or curtain, to conceal its contents from all spectators.... We have
not as yet discovered any of the statues employed in the ceremonial, but we
know what they were like, what part they played, and of what materials
they were made. They were animated.... They spoke, moved, acted&mdash;not
metaphorically, but actually.... Interminable avenues of sphinxes,
gigantic obelisks, massive pylons, halls of a hundred columns, mysterious
chambers of perpetual night&mdash;in a word, the whole Egyptian Temple and its
dependencies were built by way of a hiding-place for a performing puppet,
of which the wires were worked by a priest."</p>
</div>

<p>In an inscription which covers, according to Brugsch,
an entire wall near the Holy of Holies in the temple of
Amen-Rā it is stated that a beautiful harp, inlaid with silver
and gold and precious stones, on which to sing the praises
of the god, statues of the god himself, and numerous gates
(Selkhet) with locks of copper and dark bronze, to protect
the Holy of Holies from intrusion, were among the gifts to
the priests.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Thothmes III., in his account of his embellishments at
Karnak, says of the statues of the gods and of their secret
place (possibly the Adytum) that they were "more glorious
than what is created in heaven, more secret than the place of
the abyss, and more [invisible] than what is in the ocean."<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<small>THE AGE OF THE TEMPLE OF AMEN-RĀ AT KARNAK.</small></h2></div>


<p>If it be accepted that the arguments already put forward
justify us in regarding the temple of Amen-Rā as a solstitial
solar temple, we are brought face to face with the fact that if
it be of any great antiquity its orientation should be such
that it will no longer receive the light of the setting sun
at the summer solstice along its axis.</p>

<p>This results from the fact that there is a slow change
in what is called the obliquity of the ecliptic&mdash;that is, the
angle between the plane of the earth's equator and the plane
of the ecliptic; this change is brought about by the attraction
of the other planetary bodies affecting the plane of the
ecliptic. If these planes approach each other, the obliquity will
be reduced; the present obliquity is something like 23° 27′;
we know that 5,000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it was 24° 22′, nearly a degree more.
A difference of 1° means, then, a difference of time of about
seven thousand years. It may go down to something below
21°. Since the obliquity has been decreasing for many
thousand years, a temple directed to the rising or setting sun
at the solstice some thousands of years ago had a greater
amplitude than it requires now.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that if the orientation of the
temple and the height of the hills towards which it points be
accurately known, knowing also the precise obliquity of the
ecliptic at different epochs, we have an astronomical means of
determining the date of the original foundation of the temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114"> 114</span>
supposing, of course, that it was founded to observe the
solstice.</p>

<p>But before I go into these matters it is essential that the
evidence of Egyptologists should be considered. Very fortunately
for us in these inquiries the temple of Amen-Rā is
one of those most carefully studied by Mariette, so that the
<i>dernier mot</i> of the archæologist is at our disposal.</p>

<p>Mariette, in his magnificent memoir on Karnak,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> surpassed
himself in the care and sagacity which he displayed in
endeavouring to fix dates for the various structures in that
wonderful temple-field, and among them the various parts of
the temple of Amen-Rā.</p>

<p>In his maps, to which I now refer, each part of the
temple is coloured according to the supposed date of its
building. He points out first of all that the inscriptions on the
walls must be disregarded, as they could have been put there
at any date after the temples were built. On this point
I quote Mariette's own words:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Les couleurs marquées sur le plan servent à indiquer, au moyen de la légende
explicative placée en marge, les époques diverses de la construction des temples
et de leurs parties. Quelques mots d'explication sont ici nécessaires. Un mur
porte les cartouches de Menephtah; mais il peut avoir été construit deux-cent-cinquante
ans plus tôt par Thoutmès III. Les époques de la décoration ne sont
ainsi pas toujours les époques de la construction. Pour avoir les époques de la
décoration, il ne s'agit que de regarder les murs et les inscriptions dont ils sont
couverts. Pour avoir les époques de la construction, tout un travail de confrontation,
de comparaison, est nécessaire. Il faut s'assurer si les mêmes mains
qui ont construit le mur l'ont décoré; dans le cas contraire, il faut faire intervenir
l'archéologie dans toutes les branches de cette science qui touchent à
l'observation des lieux, au mode de construction, à l'agencement des pierres, au
choix et à l'appareillage des matériaux."</p>
</div>

<p>Taking the temple in its generality, he finds that, so far as
his inquiries had carried him, parts were certainly built at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115"> 115</span>
time an ancient as the twelfth dynasty&mdash;say 2400 or 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
according to the authority in these matters that we may
prefer.</p>

<p>Then again we have dates given and indications of kings
through the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, and then
again on to the times of the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>In such an inquiry we must have archæological dates on
which we can rely. In the date assigned to the time of Mena
by various Egyptologists we find a difference of nearly&mdash;in
fact, rather more than&mdash;a thousand years in our authorities.
In the twelfth dynasty we find a difference of five hundred
years; but in the later dynasties, such as the eighteenth, the
difference is reduced in some cases to ten years or so. So that
in the later dynasties we know pretty well what time is in
question. We are therefore on firm ground.</p>

<p>The first point to which I wish to call attention is that
according to Mariette the building dates change along the open
axis of the temple. From photographs I took when in Egypt
I found reason to believe that the direction of the axis has
been slightly changed at the west end.</p>

<p>If we refer to the plan of the temple, the point of importance
to us in our present inquiry has relation to the circumstances
connected with the buildings of the temple itself. We
have in the outer court to the north-west certain pillars which
were built by one of the Ethiopian kings. These I mark <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>
(see page <a href="#Page_118">118</a>). There is the temple <b>M</b>, built by Rameses III,
according to Mariette. There are walls with columns, marked
<b>2</b>, <b>2</b>, built by the twenty-second dynasty, north and south of this
outer court; and then there is the temple <b>L</b> in the outer court,
supposed to have been built by Seti II. The western part of
the temple, therefore, is of no high antiquity. To find this we
have to go some 200 yards to the south-east. Near the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116"> 116</span>
portion of the temple (marked <b>4</b>) there are traces of the
twelfth or possibly the eleventh dynasty. What existed then
might have been a shrine with nothing to the north-west or
south-east of it.</p>

<p>This seems almost to have been its condition at the time of
Thothmes III. even.</p>

<p>According to an inscription quoted by Brugsch,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> "The
king (Thothmes III.) found it in the form of a brick building,
in a very dilapidated condition, being a work of his predecessors.
The king with his own hand performed the solemn
laying of the foundation stone for this monument."</p>

<p>From this point, indeed, the temple seems to have extended
in both directions&mdash;that is, north-west and south-east&mdash;the
sanctuary being thrown back to the eastward and pylons added
to the westward.</p>

<p>It follows from the above very brief sketch that the original
orientation of the original shrine is to be gathered from the
walls towards the centre of the present ruins.</p>

<p>Let us agree to this. The Egyptologist already gives us
eleventh-dynasty time, say 2500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> for a part of the existing
temple.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the astronomical problem. Lepsius and
others have measured the amplitude of this part of the temple.
It is given as 20° or 20° 30′ N. of W.</p>

<p>When there I measured the height of the opposite hills
(near the tombs of the kings) roughly at 2½°. If we, therefore,
deal with the amplitude, considering the height of the hills as
2½°, we find that, as the horizon was above the sea horizon and
the sun travels down an inclined path from south to north, it
would meet the hill sooner than the sea horizon; the apparent
amplitude would, therefore, be less than the true one, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117"> 117</span>
we get an amplitude of 25° instead of 26°, and if we correct
that for refraction we get 25½°.</p>

<p>Let us take the lower amplitudes. We can construct the
following table:&mdash;</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">With present obliquity 23° 30′ we have at Thebes,<br />
lat. 25° 40′ amplitude on horizon (sun's centre)</td>
<td class="tdl">26°</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Corrected for refraction</td>
<td class="tdl">26° 30′</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">The amplitude behind hill, 2½° high, will be</td>
<td class="tdl">25°</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Making correction for refraction</td>
<td class="tdl">25° 5′</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So that, taking the lowest amplitude, the temple axis points
almost 1° too much to the north.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the photographs I had taken
of the temple axis towards, and from the outside of, the
Ptolemaic pylon indicated a twist in the temple axis. This was
a question that in the absence of accurate measurements could
only be determined by an actual observation of the solstice.</p>

<p>This being so, I begged the intervention of Col. Sir Colin
Scott-Moncrieff, the Under Secretary of State of the Public
Works Department in Egypt, to detail one of his officers to
make observations of the summer solstice of 1891. He was
good enough to accede to my request, and I proceed to give
extracts from the report of the officer in question, Mr. P. J. G.
Wakefield, to Mr. Allan Joseph, the Director of Works and
Irrigation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In accordance with instructions received, I made the following observations
at Karnak on June 21st, 1891:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I found that the points which I have marked A, C, D on the photographic
plan (being the centres of the Pylon of Rameses I., the Pylon of Thothmes I.,
and the shrine or sanctuary of Philip III. of Macedon (?) respectively) were all
in a straight line. B is a point midway between the only two opposite pillars
of which the bases are intact (one set up by Rameses I., and the other by
Seti I.), and was very nearly in line; probably the true centre between the
pillars (which is difficult to obtain) would be exactly so. The centre of the Great
Pylon (Ptolemaic) is not in line at all with these points, there being 1° difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118"> 118</span>
between D A prolonged and
A E; I therefore accepted the
line D C A as the true axis.</p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF AMEN-RĀ, SHOWING THE
POINTS REFERRED TO IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER.</div>
</div>

<p>"From an inspection made
on June 20th, it appeared to me
that the setting sun would not
be visible from any of the points
indicated by Professor Norman
Lockyer. I therefore placed the
theodolite at A. I regret to say
that my above supposition was
correct, as even from A I was
only able to see a portion of the
setting sun, the remainder being
hidden behind the south wall of
the Great Pylon. I obtained,
however, one reading, the right
limb at, as nearly as I could
judge, the moment of impact of
the sun's diameter with the hill."</p>
</div>

<p>Of the measures given
the most important are
the angle between the
axis of the temple looking
south-east from A and the
north point 116° 23′ 40″
(amplitude 26° 23′) and
the angle between the
top of the hills and the
horizontal 2° 36′ 20″.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
These measures, therefore,
entirely justified
the result of the calculations
I have before given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119"> 119</span>
and prove that the interval of over 5000 years is sufficient to
cause us to detect the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic
by this method of observing the sunset at a solstice with an
instrument built on so large a a scale.</p>

<p>Taking the orientation as 26°, and taking hills and refraction
into consideration, we find that the true horizon sunset
amplitude would be 27° 30′. This amplitude gives us for
Thebes a declination of 24° 18′.</p>

<p>This was the obliquity of the ecliptic in the year 3700
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and this is therefore the date of the <i>foundation</i> of the
shrine of Amen-Rā at Karnak, so far as we can determine it
astronomically with the available data; but about these there
is still an element of doubt, for, so far as I learn, the recent
magnetic readings have not been checked by astronomical
observations.</p>

<small>THE STARS&mdash;THEIR RISINGS AND SETTINGS.</small></h2></div>


<p>From what has been stated it is not too much to assume
that the Egyptians observed, and taught people to observe,
the sun on the horizon.</p>

<p>This being so, the chances are that at first they would
observe the stars on the horizon too, both stars rising and
stars setting; this indeed is rendered more probable by the
very careful way in which early astronomers defined the
various conditions under which a star can rise or set, always,
be it well remembered, in relation to the sun.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the ancients had no telescopes,
and had to use their horizon as the only scientific instrument
which they possessed. They spoke of a star as rising or
setting cosmically, achronically, or heliacally.</p>

<p>The cosmic rising meant that the star rose, and the cosmic
setting meant that the star set, at the same moment as the
sun&mdash;that is, that along the eastern horizon we should see
the star rising at the moment of sunrise, or along the western
horizon a star setting at the moment of the sun setting; but
unless certain very obvious precautions were taken it is clear
that neither the rising nor the setting star would be seen, in
consequence of the presence of daylight. The achronical rising
or setting is different from the cosmic in this respect&mdash;that
we have the star rising when the sun is setting, or setting
when the sun is rising. Finally we have the heliacal
rising and setting; that is taken to be that the star appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121"> 121</span>
in the morning a little in advance of the sunrise, or set at
twilight a little later than the sun.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that if we observe a star rising in the
dawn, it will get more and more difficult to observe the nearer
the time of sunrise is approached. Therefore, what the
ancients did was to determine a time before sunrise in the
early dawn at which the star could be very obviously and
clearly seen to rise. The term "heliacal rising" was coined
to represent a star rising visibly in the dawn, therefore, before
the sun. Generally throughout Egypt the sun was supposed
to be something like 10° below the horizon when a star was
stated to rise <i>heliacally</i>.</p>

<p>The following table from Biot should make matters quite
clear:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>It is Ideler's opinion that, in Ptolemy's time, in the case of
stars of the first magnitude, for heliacal risings and settings,
if the star and sun were on the same horizon, a depression of
the sun of 11° was taken; if on opposite horizons, a depression
of 7°. For stars of the second magnitude these values were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122"> 122</span>
14° and 8½°. But if temples were employed as I have
suggested, even cosmic and achronic risings and settings could
be observed in the case of the brightest stars.</p>

<p>But it must not be imagined that, even in Egypt, all stars
can be observed the moment they are above the horizon.
In the morning, especially, there are mists, so that all but
the brightest stars are often invisible till they are 1° or 2° high.
On this point I quote Biot:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Comme le rapporte Nouet, l'astronome de l'expédition française, on n'y
aperçoit jamais à leur lever les étoiles de 2° et de 3° grandeur même dans les
plus belles nuits, à cause d'une bande constant de vapeurs qui borde l'horizon.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Aussi en expliquant le calcul des levers héliaques dans l'Almageste, Ptolémée
a-t-il soin de remarquer<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> que les annonces qu'on voudrait faire de ces
phénomènes seront toujours très-incertaines, à cause de l'état des couches d'air
dans lesquelles on les observe, et à cause de la difficulté optique qu'on éprouve à
saisir la première apparition, comme il dit lui-même en avoir fait l'expérience."<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Before we begin to consider the question of stars at all, we
must be able to describe them&mdash;to speak of them in a way
that shall define exactly which star is meant. We can in these
days define a star according to its constellation, or its equatorial
or ecliptic co-ordinates, but all these means of reference were
unknown to the earliest observers. Still we may assume that
the Egyptians could define some of the stars in some fashion;
and it is evident that we here approach a matter of the very
highest importance for our subject, to which I shall have to
return in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>So far as we have been dealing with the sun and the
observations of the sun at rising and setting, we have taken for
granted that the amplitude of the sun at the solstices does not
change; the amplitude of 26° at Thebes for the solstices is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123"> 123</span>
practically, though as we have seen not absolutely, invariable
for a thousand years; but one of the results of astronomical
work is that the <i>stars</i> are known to behave quite differently.
In consequence of what is called <i>precession</i> the stars change
their place with regard to the pole of the equator; and further,
in consequence of this movement, the position of the sun among
the stars at the solstices and equinoxes changes also.</p>

<p>In reference to the sun's path we considered what are called
the ecliptic and the equatorial co-ordinates. The ecliptic
defines the plane in which the earth moves round the sun, and
90° from that plane we have the pole of the heavens; celestial
latitude we found reckoned from the plane of the ecliptic north
and south up to the pole of the heavens, and celestial longitude
was reckoned along the plane of the ecliptic from the first point
of Aries. We had also declination reckoned from the equator
of the earth prolonged to the stars, and right ascension
reckoned along the equator from the first point of Aries.</p>

<p>The pole of the heavens or of the ecliptic, then, we must
regard as practically, but not absolutely, fixed; but the pole
of the earth's equator is not fixed, it slowly moves round the
pole of the heavens. <i>In consequence of that movement there is a
change of declination in a star's place.</i></p>

<p>Going back to the diagram (p. 49), we find that the amplitude
of a body rising or setting at Thebes or anywhere else depends
upon its declination; so that if from any cause the declination
of a star changes, its amplitude must change.</p>

<p>That is the first point where we meet with difficulty,
because if the amplitude changes it is the same as saying that
the place of star-rising or star-setting changes; that is, a star
which rises in the east in a certain amplitude this year will
change its amplitude at some future time.</p>

<p>In the last chapter I referred to one of the difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124"> 124</span>
of modern inquiries into the orientation of ancient temples,
which arises from the fact that the sun has not always, at the
solstices, risen or set at exactly the same points of the horizon.
We now find ourselves face to face with the fact that the
stars do not rise or set at the same points century after century.
We saw that the change in the position of the sun on
the horizon at the solstices is due to a very small change of
obliquity of the ecliptic, so that in a matter of something like
6,000 years the position of the sun at sunrise and sunset on the
horizon may be varied by, roughly speaking, 1 degree.
But in the case of the stars the matter is very much
more serious, because in the course of something like 13,000
years the rising-or setting-places of a star may vary by something
like 47° along the horizon north or south.</p>

<p>So that in the cases both of sun and stars there is no real
fixity in the places of rising or setting, although of course
those who made the first observations and built the first
temples were not in a position to know this.</p>

<p>The real cause of this precessional movement which causes
the stars to change their places lies in the fact that the earth is
not a sphere, its equatorial diameter being longer than its polar
diameter, so that there is a mass of matter round the equator in
excess of what we should get if the earth were spherical.
Suppose that matter to be represented by a ring. The ring is
differently presented to the sun, one part being nearer than
the other, the nearer part being attracted more forcibly. If
we take the point in the ring nearest the sun where there is
the greatest attraction, and draw a line to the opposite point
where the attraction is least, we can show that the case stands
in this way: the sun's pull may be analysed into two forces,
one of them represented by the line joining the centre of the
sun and the centre of the ring, and another at right angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125"> 125</span>
to it let fall from the point most strongly attracted on to the
first line. The question is, what will that force at right
angles do?</p>

<p>The figure below represents a model illustrating the rotation
of the earth on its axis, and the concurrent revolution of the
sun round the earth once a year. To represent the downward
force it is perfectly fair if I add a weight. The moment this is
done the axis of the gyroscope representing the earth's axis,
instead of retaining its direction to the same point as it did
before, now describes a circle round the pole of the heavens.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p125" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p125.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MODEL ILLUSTRATING THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES.</div>
</div>

<p>It is now a recognised principle that there is, so to speak, a
wobble of the earth's axis round the pole of the heavens, in
consequence of the attraction of the sun on the nearer point of
this equatorial ring being greater than on the part of the
ring further removed from it. That precessional movement
is not quite so simple as it is shown by the model, because
what the sun does in this way is done to a very much larger
extent by the moon, the moon being so very much nearer to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126"> 126</span></p>

<p>In consequence, then, of this luni-solar precession we have
a variation of the points of intersection of the planes of the
earth's equator and of the ecliptic; in consequence of that we
have a difference in the constellations in which the sun is at
the time of the solstices and the equinoxes; and, still more
important from our present point of view, we have another
difference, viz., that the declinations, and therefore the amplitudes,
and therefore the places of setting and rising of the stars,
change from century to century.</p>

<p>Now that we have thus become acquainted with the physical
cause of that movement of the earth's axis which gives rise to
what is called the precession of the equinoxes, we have next to
enter with somewhat greater detail into some of the results of
the movement.</p>

<p>The change of direction of the axis in space has a cycle
of something between 25,000 and 26,000 years. As it is a
question of the change of the position of the celestial equator,
or rather of the pole of the celestial equator, amongst the stars
in relation to the pole of the heavens, of course the declinations
of stars will be changed to a very considerable extent; indeed,
we have seen that the declination of a star can vary by twice
the amount of the obliquity, or say 47°, so that a star at one
time may have zero declination&mdash;that is, it may lie on the
equator&mdash;and at another it may have a declination 47° N. or
S. Or, again, a star may be the pole star at one particular
time, and at another it will be distant from the pole no less
than 47°. Although we get this enormous change in one
equatorial co-ordinate, there would from this cause alone be
practically no change with regard to the corresponding ecliptic
co-ordinate&mdash;that is to say, the position of the star with reference
to the earth's movement round the sun. This movement
takes place quite independently of the direction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127"> 127</span>
axis, so that while we get this tremendous swirl in declination,
the latitudes of the stars or their distances from the ecliptic
north or south will scarcely change at all.</p>

  <div class="caption">STAR-MAP. REPRESENTING THE PRECESSIONAL MOVEMENT OF THE CELESTIAL POLE
FROM THE YEAR 4000 B.C. TO THE YEAR 2000 A.D.
(<i>From Piazzi Smyth.</i>)<br />
<small><i>Symbols adapted to represent the magnitudes or brightnesses of the stars</i>, <i>1<sup>st</sup>.</i> ⊙,

</div>

<p>Among other important results of these movements dependent
upon precession we have the various changes in the pole-star
from period to period, due to the various positions occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"> 128</span>
by the pole of the earth's equator. We thus see how in this
period of 25,000 years or thereabouts the pole-stars will
change, for a pole-star is merely the star near the pole of the
equator for the time being. At present, as we all know, the
pole-star is in the constellation Ursa Minor. During the last
25,000 years the pole-stars have been those lying nearest to a
curved line struck from the pole of the heavens with a radius
equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic, which, as we have
seen, is liable to change within small limits; so that about
10,000 or 12,000 years ago the pole-star was no longer the
little star in Ursa Minor that we all know, but the bright star
Vega, in the constellation Lyra. Of course 25,000 years ago
the pole-star was practically the same as it is at present.</p>

<p>Associated with this change in the pole-star, the point of
intersection of the two fundamental planes (the plane of the
earth's rotation and the plane of the earth's revolution) will be
liable to change, and the period will be the same&mdash;about
25,000 years. Where these two planes cut each other we have
the equinoxes, because the intersection of the planes defines for
us the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes; when the sun is
highest and lowest half-way between these points we have the
solstices. In a period of 25,000 years the star which is nearest
to an equinox will return to it, and that which is nearest a solstice
will return to it. During the period there will be a constant
change of stars marking the equinoxes and the solstices.</p>

<p>The chief points in the sun's yearly path then will change
among the stars in consequence of this precession. It is perfectly
clear that if we have a means of calculating back the
old positions of stars, and if we have any very old observations,
we can help matters very much, because the old
observations&mdash;if they were accurately made&mdash;would tell us
that such and such a star rose with the sun at the solstice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129"> 129</span>
or at the equinox at some special point of ancient time. If
it be possible to calculate the time at which the star occupied
that position with regard to the sun, we have an astronomical
means of determining the time, within a few years, at which
that particular observation was made.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have such a means of calculation,
and it has been employed very extensively at different
periods, chiefly by M. Biot in France, and quite recently
by German astronomers, in calculating the positions of the
stars from the present time to a period of 2000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
We can thus determine with a very high degree of accuracy
the latitude, longitude, right ascension, declination, and the
relation of the stars to an equinox, a solstice, or a pole, as
far back as we choose. Since we have the planes of the
equator and ecliptic cutting each other at different points in
consequence of the cause which I have pointed out&mdash;the
attraction of the sun and moon&mdash;we have a fixed equator
and a variable equator depending upon that. In consequence
of the attraction of the planets upon the earth, the plane of the
ecliptic itself is not fixed, so that we have not only a variable
equator, but also a variable ecliptic. What has been done in
these calculations is to determine the relations and the results
of these variations.</p>

<p>The calculations undertaken for the special purposes of
this book will be referred to later.</p>

<p>A simpler, though not so accurate a method consists in
the use of a processional globe. In this we have two fixed
points at the part of the globe representing the poles of the
heavens, on which the globe may be rotated; when this is
done the stars move absolutely without any reference to the
earth or to the plane of the equator, but purely with reference
to the ecliptic. We have, then, this globe quite independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130"> 130</span>
of the earth's axis, flow can we make it dependent upon
the earth's axis? We have two brass circles at a distance of
23½° from each pole of the heavens (north and south); these
represent the circle described by the pole of the earth in the
period of 25,000 years. In these circles are forty-eight holes
in which I can fix two additional clamping screws, and rotate
the globe with respect to them by throwing out of gear the
two points which produced the ecliptic revolution.</p>

<p>If I use that part of the brass circle which is occupied
by our present pole-star, we get the apparent revolution of the
heavens with the earth's axis pointing to the pole-star of
to-day. If we wish to investigate the position of things, say
8,000 years ago, we bring the globe back again to its bearings,
and then adjust the screws into the holes in the brass circles
which are proper for that period. When we have the globe
arranged to 6000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, 8,000 years ago), in order
to determine the equator at that time all we have to do is to
paint a line on the globe-in some water-colour, by holding a
camel's-hair pencil at the east or west point of the wooden
horizon. That line represents the equator 8,000 years ago.
Having that line, of course, the intersection of the equator
with the ecliptic will give us the equinoxes, so that we may
affix a wafer to represent the vernal equinox. Or if we take
that part of the ecliptic which is nearest to the North Pole,
and, therefore, the N. declination of which is greatest, viz., 23½°
N., we have there the position of the sun at the summer
solstice, and 23½° S. will give us the position of the sun at
the winter solstice. So by means of such a globe as this it
is possible to determine roughly the position of the equator
among the stars, and note those four important points in the
solar year, the two equinoxes and the two solstices. I have
taken a period of 8,000 years, but I might just as easily have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131"> 131</span>
taken a greater or a smaller one. By means of this arrangement,
therefore, we can determine within a very small degree
of error, without any laborious calculations, the distance of
a star north or south of the equator, <i>i.e.</i>, its declination, at any
point of past or future time.</p>

<p>The positions thus found, say, for intervals of 500 years,
may be plotted on a curve, so that we can, with a considerable
amount of accuracy, obtain the star's place for any year.
Thus the globe may be made to tell us that in the year
1000 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the declination of Fomalhaut was 35° S., in 1000
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it was 42°, in 2000 it was about 44°, in 4000 it was
a little over 42° again, but in 6000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it had got up to
about 33°, and in 8000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to about 22°.</p>

<p>The curve of Capella falls from 41° N. at 0 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> to 10°
at 5500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, so we have in these 5500 years in the case of
this star run through a large part of that variation to which
I have drawn attention.</p>

<p>I have ascertained that the globe is a very good guide
indeed within something like 1° of declination. Considering
the difficulty of the determination of amplitudes in the case
of buildings, it is clear that the globe may be utilised with
advantage, at all events to obtain a first approximation.</p>

<small>THE EGYPTIAN HEAVENS&mdash;THE ZODIACS OF DENDERAH.</small></h2></div>


<p>We can readily understand that in the very beginning of
observations in all countries, the moment man began to observe
anything, he took note of the stars, and as soon as he began to
talk about them he must have started by defining, in some way
or other, the particular stars he meant.</p>

<p>Observers would first consider the brightest stars, and
separate them from the dimmer ones; they would then discuss
the stars which never set, and separate them from those which
did rise and set; then they would take the most striking configurations,
whether large or small. They would naturally, in
a Northern clime, choose out the constellation the Great Bear,
or Orion, and for small groups the Pleiades. These would
attract attention, and be named before anything else. Then,
later on, it would be imperative, in order to connect their solar
with their stellar observations, that they should name the stars
which lay along the sun's path in the heavens, or those the
rising of which heralded the sunrise at their festivals. They
would confine their attention to a belt round the equator
rather than consider the configuration of stars half-way between
the equator and the north pole. In all countries&mdash;India,
China, Babylonia, Egypt&mdash;they had eventually such a girdle
round the heavens, called by different names in different
countries, and the use of this girdle of stars, which sometimes
consisted of twenty-eight stations, sometimes of twenty-seven,
and sometimes of less, was to enable them to define the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133"> 133</span>
of the sun, moon, or of any of the planets in relation to any
of these stars.</p>

<p>Not very many years ago, when the literature of China and
India was as a sealed book, and the hieroglyphics of Egypt
and the wedges of Babylonia were still unread, we had to
depend for the earliest traces of astronomical observation upon
the literatures of Greece and Syria, and according to these
sources the asterisms first specialised and named were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Book of Job we read, "Canst thou bind the sweet
influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou
bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide
Arcturus with his sons?"</p>

<p>Here we have the difficulty which has met everybody in
going back into these old records, because there was no absolute
necessity for a common language at the time; it was open to
everyone to call the stars any name they chose in any country,
therefore it is difficult for scholars to find out what particular
stars or constellations were meant by any particular words. In
the Revised Version, Arcturus has given place to "the Bear with
its train," and even our most distinguished scholars do not know
what Mazzaroth means. I wrote to Professor Robertson Smith
to ask him to give me the benefit of his great knowledge,
and he tells me that Mazzaroth is probably that band of stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134"> 134</span>
round the ecliptic or round the equator to which I have referred,
but he will only commit himself to the statement that it
is a probable enough conjecture; other people believe that it
was a reference to the Milky Way.</p>

<p>I mention this to show how very difficult this inquiry
really is. The "seven stars" are held by many to mean
the Pleiades, and not the Great Bear; but this, I think, is
very improbable.</p>

<p>Much is to be hoped from the study of the Babylonian
records in relation to the Egyptian ones. This is a point
I shall return to in the sequel.</p>

<p>In observing stars nowadays, we use a transit circle which
is carried round by the earth so as to pick up the stars in
different circles round the axis of the earth prolonged, and by
altering the inclination of the telescope of this instrument we
can first get a circle of one declination and then a circle of
another.</p>

<p>The Egyptians did not usually employ meridian observations.
Did the Egyptians make star maps? They certainly
did, as we shall see.</p>

<p>The first bit of solid information specially bearing upon
ancient Egyptian constellations was gained at the temple of
Denderah, a place which the traveller up the Nile reaches before
he arrives so far as Thebes. Perhaps among the reasons why
so great attention was given to the so-called zodiacs of
Denderah was the fact that one of them, having been rudely
wrenched from its resting-place in the platform of one of the
temples, had been carried to the museum in Paris, so that the
thing itself was <i>en évidence</i> and capable of being examined by
experts whose opinions were of value, and by all the world
besides.</p>

<p>The chief temple, when explored by the French expedition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135"> 135</span>
was deeply buried in the sand. In the front part of it, covering
the ceiling, before one enters the temple itself, there is displayed
the square zodiac, so called, to which I shall have to
refer briefly. The temple was pointed within a few degrees of
north; at the north-east corner of the zodiac is a device, since
found to represent the sunlight falling upon a statue of the
Goddess of the Shrine. Investigations have shown that the
zodiac includes a reference to a great many celestial phenomena
of the utmost importance. There is no difficulty in recognising
some of the zodiacal signs, but there the resemblance to the
modern zodiac ends, for the reason that each of the strange
processions of mythological personages represents not only
constellations, with some of which we may be familiar, but a
great deal more. It is noteworthy that the illustration of the
very first astronomical point which we have to consider brings
out the fact that it is impossible to disconnect Egyptian
mythology from astronomy.</p>

<p>In the southern half of the zodiac, the lower part is occupied
by stars represented in the guise of different mythological
personages, sailing along in boats; and above them we get half
of the zodiac with the signs of the Fish, the Ram, the Bull and
the Twins represented. In the middle section the sun's course
in different parts of the day, and different parts of the year, is
given: whilst, outermost of all, we get the twelve solar positions,
occupied by the sun each hour from rising to setting,
represented by twelve boats. It may be here mentioned that
in ancient Egypt, as in the modern Eastern world, both day
and night always consisted of twelve hours; unequal, of course,
the length of the hours varying according to the time of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136"> 136</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p136" style="max-width: 93.75em;">

<div class="caption"> NORTHERN HALF OF THE SO-CALLED SQUARE ZODIAC OF DENDERAH. </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137"> 137</span></p>

<p>Now, if we take the opposite side, that is the north-west
corner, we find that we have to do chiefly with the opposite
part of the sky, including the signs of the Lion, the Scales,
and Sagittarius, and below them other stars are represented
as mythological personages in boats. The courses of the sun
and moon are next given, and some of the lunar mythology
is revealed to us. We see Osiris represented by the moon,
and by an eye at the top of fourteen steps, which symbolise
the fourteen days of the waxing moon.</p>

<p>In the square zodiac, then, there is an immense amount
of astronomy. In the round zodiac, found in another temple
(<i>see</i> p. 18), there are some points which at once claim our
attention. There is, first, a mythological figure of a cow in a
boat, and, near it, another mythological figure, which the subsequent
reading of inscriptions has proved to represent the
constellation Orion. In the centre of the zodiac we have
a jackal, and there is very little doubt that it represents
the constellation which we now call the Little Bear, which
then, as now, was near the pole. Not far away, we get
the leg of an animal; this, we now know, was a constellation
called the Thigh, and there seems to be absolutely
no question that it represents the constellation which we
now call the Great Bear. Again, close by is another mythological
form, which we know represents the Hippopotamus.
This was made up out of some of the group of stars which
forms the present constellation Draco. There are also two
hieroglyphs which subsequent research has proved to represent
setting stars and rising stars, so that, whatever may have
been the date of this round zodiac of Denderah, it is clear that
we are dealing with a time when the stars had been classed
in constellations, one of which, the constellation Orion, even
survives to our own day.</p>

<p>It is little to be wondered at that, when these revelations
first burst upon the scientific world, great excitement was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138"> 138</span>
produced. It was obvious that we had to do with a nation
which had very definite ideas of astronomy, and that the
astronomy was very closely connected with worship. It
was also certainly suggested by so many animal forms, that
we had to do with a people whose condition was not unlike
that of the American Indians&mdash;to take a well-known
instance&mdash;at the beginning of this century, one in which
each tribe, or clan, had chosen a special animal <i>totem</i>.</p>

<p>It so happened that, while these things were revealing
themselves, the discussions concerning them, which took
place among the scientific world of France, were partly
influenced by the writings of a man of very brilliant imagination
and of great erudition. I refer to Dupuis, according
to whose views an almost fabulous antiquity might be assigned
to ancient traditions in general and astronomical traditions
in particular. It is needless to say, however, that there
were others to take the extreme opposite view&mdash;who held the
opinion that his imagination had run away with his learning.</p>

<p>With all this new work before them, and with a genius
like Champollion's among them, it was not long before the
French <i>savans</i> compelled the hieroglyphs to give up some
of their secrets. First one word gave two or three letters,
then another two or three more, and finally an alphabet
and syllabary were constructed. So it was not long before
some of the inscriptions at Denderah were read. Then it
was found that the temple, as it then stood, had certainly
been, partly at all events, embellished so late as the time
of the Roman Emperors. Naturally there was then a
tremendous reaction from the idea of fabulous antiquity
which had been urged by the school of Dupuis. There
were two radically opposed camps, led by Letronne, a distinguished
archæologist, and Biot, one of the most eminent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139"> 139</span>
astronomers of his day, and both of these <i>savans</i> brought
papers before the Academy of Inscriptions. Biot's first
paper was read in 1822, and was replied to by Letronne
in 1824; Biot wrote his next paper in 1844, in which he
held to everything that he had stated in his first memoir;
and this was replied to, the next year, by Letronne.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p139" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p139.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SIRIUS AND ORION (18TH DYNASTY). (<i>From Brugsch.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Biot had no difficulty whatever in arriving at the conclusion
that, precisely as in the case of the sphere of Eudoxus,
a prior bone of contention, however true it might be that,
the circular zodiac had been sculptured in the time of the
Roman emperors, still it certainly referred to a time far
anterior; and he suggested that we have in it sculptures
reproducing very old drawings, which had been made long
before on parchment or on stone. He pointed out that in the
condition of astronomy one would expect to be extant in
ancient times, it was far easier to reproduce old drawings
than to calculate back what the positions of the stars had
been at some prior date, so that in his magnificent summing-up
of the case in his last paper, he rested his scientific
reputation on the statement that the sculptures of Denderah
represent the celestial sphere on a plane round the north
pole of the equator at a year not far removed from 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
More than this, he stated that the time of the year was the
time of the summer solstice, and the hour was midnight.
He also showed that, calculating back what the position of
the stars would have been at midnight on the 20th of June
(Gregorian), 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the constellations, and even many of
the separate stars shown in the medallion, would occupy
exactly the places they did occupy in the projection employed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140"> 140</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p140" style="max-width: 93.75em;">

  <div class="caption">ASTRONOMICAL DRAWINGS FROM BIBÂN EL-MULÛK (18TH DYNASTY).
(<i>From "Description de l'Égypte."</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141"> 141</span></p>
<p>Let us then, for the moment, assume this to be true. What
does it tell us? That 700 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in Egypt the solstice was
recognised; a means of determining the instant of midnight
with more or less precision was known; observations of the
stars were regularly made; the risings of some of them were
associated with the rising of the sun, and many of them had
been collected into groups or constellations.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful result. I suppose that Biot is universally
held to have proved his case; in fact, Brugsch,
who is now regarded as one of the highest authorities in
Egyptian history, has shown that almost every detail seen in
the zodiac of Denderah reproduces inscriptions or astronomical
figures, unearthed since the date of Biot's memoir, which,
without doubt, must be referred to the time of the Eighteenth
Dynasty&mdash;that is, 1700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or thereabouts; so that practically
the Egyptologist has now chapter and verse for many things in
the zodiac of Denderah dating 1,000 years before the period
assigned to it by Biot.</p>

<p>The next point to notice is connected with the astronomical
drawings which have been found in the Ramesseum at Thebes&mdash;drawings
which also have very obvious connections with the
zodiac of Denderah. On these we find the hieroglyphics for
the different months&mdash;the constellations Orion, Hippopotamus,
and Jackal, as we saw them at Denderah, and another form
of the constellation of the Thigh. There is certainly the
closest connection between the two sets of delineations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142"> 142</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p142" style="max-width: 93.75em;">

  <div class="caption">RUINS OF THE RAMESSEUM, WHERE THE MONTH-TABLES WERE FOUND.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143"> 143</span></p>

<p>Biot set himself to investigate what was the probable date
to which the inscriptions in the Ramesseum referred. When
we have the months arranged in a certain relationship to
certain constellations we have an opening for the discussion of
the precessional movements; in other words, for the consideration
of the various changes brought about by the swinging of
the pole of the equator round the pole of the ecliptic. Here, again,
there was no uncertain sound given out by the research. Biot
pointed out that we are here in presence of records, no longer
of a summer solstice, as in the case of Denderah, but of a
spring equinox, the date being 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He further suggested
that, in all probability, one of the mythological figures might
be a representation of the intersection of the ecliptic and the
equator in the constellation Taurus at the date mentioned.
This undoubtedly, to a large extent, justifies what Dupuis had
long before pointed out&mdash;that the perpetual reference to the
Bull found in ancient records and mythologies arose from the
fact that this constellation occupied an important position at
a critical time in the year, which would indicate a very
considerable lapse of time. This idea was justified by the
researches of Biot, because we are driven back by them to
a date preceding 3000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> We find in the table at the
Ramesseum distinct references to the Bull, the Lion and the
Scorpion, and it is also clearly indicated that at that time the
star Sirius rose heliacally at the beginning of the Nile-rise.</p>

<p>The month-table at Thebes tells us that the sun's journey
in relation to some of the zodiacal constellations was perfectly
familiar 5000 years ago.</p>

<small>THE CIRCUMPOLAR CONSTELLATIONS: THE MYTH OF HORUS.</small></h2></div>


<p>There was to all early peoples all the difference in the
world, of course, between day and night, while we, with our
firm knowledge, closely associate them. There was no artificial
illumination such as we have, and the dark night did not
so much typify rest as death; so
that the coming of the glorious
morning of tropical or sub-tropical
climates seemed to be a re-awakening
to all the joys and delights and
activities of life; thus the difference
between night and day was to
the ancient Egyptians almost the
difference between death and life.
We can imagine that darkness thus
considered by a mythologically-thinking
people was regarded as
the work of an enemy, and hence,
in time, their natural enemies were
represented as being the friends of
darkness.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp40" id="i_p144" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p144.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE GOD OF DARKNESS&mdash;SET.</div>
</div>

<p>Here a very interesting astronomical
point comes in. With these views, there must have
been a very considerable difference in the way the Egyptians
regarded those stars which were always visible and those
which rose and set.</p>

<p>The region occupied by the stars always visible depends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145"> 145</span>
of course, upon the latitude of the place. Taking Thebes,
with its latitude of 26°, as representing Egypt, the area of stars
always visible was about one-fourth of that visible to us, so
that there would be a very sharp distinction between the stars
constantly seen at night, and those which rose and set, the
rising stars being regarded as heralds of the sunrise. It seems
very probable that the circumpolar stars were quite early
regarded as representing the powers of darkness, because they
were there, visible in the dark, always disappearing and never
appearing at sunrise. If that were so, no doubt prayers
would be as necessary to propitiate them as those powers or
gods which were more beneficent; and, as a matter of fact,
one finds that the god Set&mdash;identified sometimes with Typhon,
Anubis, and Tebha&mdash;was amongst the greatest gods of ancient
Egypt.</p>

<p>The female form of Typhon&mdash;his wife&mdash;was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"> 146</span>
Taurt or Thoueris, represented generally as a hippopotamus.</p>

<p>It is probable that the crocodile was a variant of the
hippopotamus in some nomes, both having reference to our
modern constellation Draco.</p>

<p>If we return for a moment to the zodiac of Denderah,
we find that the constellations which I indicated&mdash;the Thigh,
the Hippopotamus and the Jackal&mdash;represent our present constellations
of the Great Bear, Draco, and the Little Bear, which
were all of them circumpolar; that is, they neither rose nor
set at the time of the inscription of the zodiac of Denderah.
It therefore will not surprise us, with the above suggested
explanation in mind, to hear that the Hippopotamus was called
the Wife of Set, the Thigh the Thigh of Set, and the Jackal
the Jackal of Set.</p>

<p>In the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., we read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147"> 147</span>
following reference to some of the northern stars and constellations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The gods Mestha, Hāpi, Tuamāutef, and Qebhsennuf are those, namely,
which find themselves behind the constellation of the Thigh in the northern
heavens."</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Again, inscribed in the kings' graves at Thebes we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The four Northern Genii are the four gods of the follower [some constellation].
They keep back the conflict of the terrible one [Typhon]. He is a great
quarreller. They trim the foresail and look after the mizen in the bark of Rā, in
company with the sailors, who are the four constellations<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> [aχemu-sek], which are
found in the northern heavens. The constellation of the Thigh appears at the
late rising. When this constellation is in the middle of the heavens, having
come to the south, where Orion lies [Orion typifying the southern part of the
skies], the other stars are wending their way to the western horizon. Regarding
the Thigh; it is the Thigh of Set, so long as it is seen in the northern heavens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148"> 148</span>
there is a band [of stars?] to the two [sword handles?] in the shape of a great
bronze chain. It is the place of Isis in the shape of a Hippopotamus to guard."</p>
</div>

<p>In the square zodiac at Denderah we find an illustration
of the Hippopotamus and the Thigh, and the chain referred
to in the inscription is there also. It will be quite worth
while to see whether this chain is not justified by some line
of stars between the chief stars in Draco and those in the
Great Bear.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the associated mythology. We see
that the astronomical ideas have a most definite character;
we learn also from the inscriptions dating from the Eighteenth
Dynasty, that the Egyptians at that time recognised three
different risings. There was the rising at sunset, the rising
at midnight, and the rising at dawn. Plutarch says that the
Hippopotamus was certainly one of the forms of Typhon,
and a reference to the myth of Horus, so beautifully told
twenty years ago and illustrated by Naville by the help
of inscriptions at Edfû, will show how important this identification
is.</p>

<p>Naville rightly pointed out how vital the study of mythology
becomes with regard to the advancement of any kind
of knowledge of the thoughts and actions of the ancient
Egyptians. Mythology, as Bunsen said, is one of the poles of
the existence of every nation; hence it will be well not to
neglect the opportunity thus afforded of studying the astronomical
basis of one of the best-known myths.</p>

<p>First a word about the mythology of Horus. Generally
we begin with the statement usually made that Horus meant
the young (or rising) sun. But inquiry shows that Horus
was something more than this; the Egyptians were great
generalisers.</p>

<p>If we put the facts already known into diagrammatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149"> 149</span>
form, we find that the condition of things is something like
the following:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">HORUS = <span class="smcap">Sun, Planet, or Constellation Rising</span>.</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">

<p>The table shows that, although the Egyptians undoubtedly
called the rising sun Horus, the planets
and constellations when rising were in
certain cases called Horus too. We do
not get any individual star rising referred
to as Horus; they were always considered
as goddesses. Hence, Horus seems to
include constellations&mdash;that is, groups of
stars rising&mdash;but not single stars.</p>

<div class="figright illowp35" id="i_p149" style="max-width: 13.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p149.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SET-HORUS.</div>
</div>

<p>Since the northern constellations were
symbolised by the name of Set, the god
of darkness, we should take Set-Horus to
mean that the stars in the Dragon were
rising at sunrise. This may explain the
meaning of a remarkable figure which
has set Egyptologists thinking a great
deal. It is the combination of Horus
and Set&mdash;a body of Horus with two heads, those of the
hawk and jackal.</p>

<p>Now then for the myth. The reason why Naville went
to the temple of Edfû for his facts is that in the later-time
temples&mdash;and this is one of them&mdash;the inscriptions on the walls
have chiefly to do with myth and ritual, whereas in the period
covered by the earlier dynasties the temple inscriptions
related chiefly to the doings of the kings. When we come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150"> 150</span>
to read the story which Naville brings before us, it looks as
though the greatest antiquity must be conceded to it from
the fact that the god Horus&mdash;the rising sun&mdash;is accompanied
by the Hor-shesu, the followers or worshippers of Horus.
These people are almost prehistoric, even in Egyptian history.
De Rougé says of them, as I have previously pointed out,
<i>C'est le type de l'antiquité la plus reculée</i>. They represent,
possibly, the old sun-worshippers at a time when as yet there
was no temple of the sun. Now, in this famous myth of
Horus, Horus, accompanied and aided by the Hor-shesu, does
battle with Typhon, the god of darkness, who had killed
his father Osiris, and Horus avenges his father in the manner
indicated in the various inscriptions and illustrative drawings
given in the temple of Edfû. How does he do it? We find
that in this conflict to revenge his father Osiris, he is
represented in a boat killing a hippopotamus with ten darts,
the beast being ultimately cut up into eight pieces. In some
drawings it is a hippopotamus that he is slaying; in others,
possibly for some totemic reason, a crocodile has been selected,
but we can only see that it has been a crocodile by the
fact that a little piece of the tail remains. Doubtless the
reference had been found objectionable by some crocodile-worshipping
people.</p>

<p>In very many inscriptions the constellation which, as I
have stated, represents the hippopotamus, is really represented
as a crocodile, or as a crocodile resting on the shoulders of a
hippopotamus, so that there is no doubt that the crocodile and
the hippopotamus were variants; and we can quite understand,
further, that the hippopotamus must have been brought into
Egypt by a tribe with that totem, who must have come from
a very long way up the Nile, since the hippopotamus was
never indigenous in the lower reaches of the river; so that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151"> 151</span>
have in the myth to do with a hippopotamus-worshipping
tribe, which, for that reason, probably came from a region
very far to the south. There is evidence of local tribes in
Egypt among which the crocodile was sacred.</p>

AND HIPPOPOTAMUS, AND HORUS SLAYING THE CROCODILE, AND THE CONSTELLATION
OF THE THIGH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The astronomical explanation of this myth is, I think, very
clear. The inscriptions relating to one of the very earliest
of the illustrations refers to Horus, "the great god, the light
of the heavens, the lord of Edfû, <i>the bright ray which appears
on the horizon</i>." The myth, therefore, I take it, simply means
that <i>the rising sun destroys the circumpolar stars</i>. These stars
are represented in the earliest forms of the myth either by
the crocodile or the hippopotamus; of course they disappeared
(or were killed) at sunrise. Horus, the bright ray on the
horizon, is victorious by destroying the crocodile and the
hippopotamus, which represent the powers of darkness.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p152.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HORUS AND CROCODILES.</div>
</div>

<p>This is a general statement. I should not make it if
I could not go a little further. There is an astronomical
test of its validity, to which I must call attention. The effect
of precession is extremely striking on the constellations near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152"> 152</span>
the pole, for the reason that the pole is constantly changing,
and the changes in the apparent position of the stars there
soon become very obvious. The stars in Draco were circumpolar,
and could, therefore,
have been destroyed
(or rendered invisible),
as the hippopotami were
destroyed in the myth
by the rising sun, about
5000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and be
it noted that at that
time there was only one
star in the Great Bear
(or the Thigh) which
was circumpolar. But at
2000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the stars
in Ursa Major were the
circumpolar ones, and
the chief stars in the
constellation Draco,
which formed the ancient
constellation of the Hippopotamus,
rose and set;
so that, if there is anything
at all in the explanation
of the myth
which I have given, and
if there is anything at all in the idea that the myth is very
ancient and refers to the time when the constellation of the
Hippopotamus was really circumpolar&mdash;a time 7000 years
ago&mdash;we ought to find that as the myth existed in more
recent times, we should no longer be dealing with Draco or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153"> 153</span>
the Hippopotamus, because Draco
was no longer circumpolar.</p>

<div class="figright illowp50" id="i_p153" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p153.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HORUS AND CROCODILES.</div>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, in later
times we get Horus destroying no
longer the Hippopotamus or the
Crocodile, but <i>the Thigh of Set</i>;
and, as I have said, 2000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
the Thigh occupied exactly the
same position in the heavens with
regard to the pole as the Hippopotamus
or the Crocodile did 3000
years before.</p>

<p>Thus, I think, we may claim
that this myth is astronomical from
top to bottom; it is as old as, and
probably rather older than, Naville thought, because it must
certainly have originated in a period somewhere about 5000
years <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, otherwise the constellation
of the Hippopotamus would not have
figured in it.</p>

<p>The various illustrations of Horus
on the crocodiles are a reference to
the myth we have just discussed.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that if
the myth were astronomical in origin
there was no reason why it should
be limited to Horus representing the
rising sun; we accordingly find it
extended to the god Ptah.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp50" id="i_p153a" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p153a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">PTAH AND CROCODILES.</div>
</div>

<p>But although I hold that the
<i>astronomical</i> meaning of the myth is
that the rising sun kills the circum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154"> 154</span>polar
stars, I do not think that is the last word. A conflict is
suggested between a people who worship the rising sun and
another who worship the circumpolar stars. I shall show in
the sequel that there is an astronomical suggestion of the
existence of two such distinct races, and that the companions
of the sun-god of Edfû must probably be distinguished from
the northern Hor-shesu.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here we may conclude our reference to the stars which,
in the latitude of Egypt, do not rise and set&mdash;or, rather,
did not rise and set at the epochs of time we have been
considering.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>TEMPLES DIRECTED TO THE STARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>I have now to pass from the circumpolar stars to those which
both rise and set. The difference between the two groups&mdash;those
that do not rise and set and those which do&mdash;was fully
recognised by the Egyptians, and many references are made
to the fact in the inscriptions.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I have given reasons to show that
some of the earliest solar temples in Egypt were not oriented
to the solstice.</p>

<p>The temple of Amen-Rā at Karnak, however, and others
elsewhere were built in such a manner that at sunset at the
summer solstice&mdash;that is, on the longest day in the year&mdash;the
sunlight entered the temple and penetrated along the axis to
the sanctuary. I also pointed out that a temple oriented in
this manner truly to a solstice was a scientific instrument of
very high precision, as by it the length of the year could be
determined with the greatest possible accuracy, provided only
that the observations were continued through a sufficient period
of time.</p>

<p>All the temples in Egypt, however, are not oriented in such
a way that the sunlight can enter them at this or any other
time of the year. They are not therefore solar temples, and
they cannot have had this use. The critical amplitude for a
temple built at Thebes so that sunlight can enter it at sunrise
or sunset is about 26° north and south of east and west, so that
any temples facing more northerly or southerly are precluded
from having the sunlight enter them at any time in the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156"> 156</span></p>

<p>It is imperative to be perfectly definite and clear on the
question of the amplitudes above 26° at Thebes. I repeat,
therefore, that any amplitude within 26° means that up to that
point the sun at sunrise or sunset could be observed some day
or days of the year&mdash;once only in the year if the amplitude is
exactly at the maximum, twice if the maximum is not reached.
But in the case of these temples with greater amplitudes than
26°, it is quite clear that they can have had nothing to do with
the sun.</p>

<p>This being so, we have the problem presented to us
whether or not temples were built so that starlight might fall
along their axes in exactly the same way that the sunlight
could fall along the axes of the solar temples when the sun
was rising in the morning or setting in the evening.</p>

<p>It is abundantly clear that temples with a greater amplitude
than 26° were oriented to stars if they were oriented at all by
astronomical considerations. How can this question be studied?
What means of investigation are at our disposal?</p>

<p>Suppose that the movements of the stars are absolutely
regular; that there is no change from year to year, from
century to century, from æon to æon; then, of course, the
question as to whether or not these temples were pointed to
a star, at rising or setting, would be easily and sufficiently
settled by going to see; because if the stars did not change
their apparent places in the heavens&mdash;accurately speaking, their
declinations&mdash;and, therefore, the amplitudes at which they
appear to rise and set, then, of course, a temple consecrated
to Sirius ten thousand years ago would view the rising or
setting of Sirius now as it did then.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, astronomy tells us, as we have
seen, that the apparent positions of the stars are liable to
change. The change is much greater in the case of the stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157"> 157</span>
than it is in the case of the sun, referred to in Chapters VI. and
XI.; but still we have seen that the latter is one which has to
be reckoned with the moment it becomes a question of inquiry
into any time far removed from the present.</p>

<div class="figright illowp45" id="i_p157" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p157.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GROUND PLAN OF EDFÛ.</div>
</div>

<p>Hence, although in the case of the sun, there is, of course,
no processional movement, and
although a temple once oriented to
the sun would remain so for a long
time; still, after some thousands of
years, the change in the obliquity
of the ecliptic would produce a
small change in the amplitude at
which a solstice is observed.</p>

<p>But while, in the case of the
sun, we have to deal with a change
of something like 1° in seven
thousand years; we have to face
in the case of the stars a maximum
change of something like 47° in a
period of thirteen thousand years.
The change of declination must
be accompanied by a change of
amplitude, and therefore by a
change in the direction of the
temples.</p>

<p>Hence, when we get a temple of known date, with an amplitude
which has been accurately measured, we can determine
from that amplitude the exact declination of the body the
temple was intended to observe, supposing, of course, that
the temple was oriented upon any astronomical considerations
at all. If the declination of the body turns out to be 23° 30′
or less, the temple may have been, in all probability was, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158"> 158</span>
solar one; if the declination is greater it cannot have had anything
to do with the sun directly.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p158" style="max-width: 75em;">

</div>
</div>

<p>This being so, it will be understood why in an inquiry
of this kind it is obviously desirable to begin with a region
in which the number of temples is considerable. Such a condition
we have in the region near Thebes; and the directions
of the axes of the different temples&mdash;that is, the orientation
of each of them, or, in other words, the amplitude of the
direction in which each temple points&mdash;have all been tabulated.
Chief among these we have the large temple of Karnak,
showing that the amplitude of its orientation is 26° north of
west, and the temple of Mut, showing that its orientation
is 72½° north of east. There is a temple at right angles to
the temple at Karnak, and again another with an amplitude
of 63° south of west, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159"> 159</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p159" style="max-width: 93.75em;">

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF RAMSES II. IN THE MEMNONIA AT THEBES (FROM LEPSIUS) SHOWING THE PYLON
AT THE OPEN END AND THE SANCTUARY AT THE CLOSED ONE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160"> 160</span></p>

<p>It may be stated generally that at Karnak itself, not to
go farther afield, there are two well-marked series of temples
which cannot, for the reason given, be solar, since one series
faces a few degrees from the north, and the other a few
degrees from the south. There are similar temples scattered
all along the Nile valley.</p>

<p>When we come to examine these non-solar temples, the first
question is, Do they resemble the solar ones in construction?
Are the horizontal telescope conditions retained? The evidence
on this point is overwhelming. Take the Temple of
Hathor at Denderah. It points very far away from the
sun; the sun's light could never have enfiladed it; in many
others pointing well to the north or south the axis extends
from the exterior pylon to the Sanctuary or Naos, which is
found always at the closed end of the temple; we have the
same number of pylons, gradually getting narrower and narrower
as we get to the Naos, and in some there is a gradual
rise from the first exterior pylon to the part which represents
the section of the Naos, so that a beam of horizontal light
coming through the central door might enter it over the heads
of the people flocking into the outer courts of the temple, and
pass uninterruptedly into the Sanctuary.</p>

<p>In this way the Egyptians had, if they chose to use it,
a most admirable arrangement for observing, with considerable
accuracy, either the rising or the setting of any celestial body,
whether it were sun or star, and especially the possibility of
observing a <i>cosmical</i> rising, as the eye was shielded from
the sunrise light, and the place of rising was completely
indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161"> 161</span></p>

<p>In these, as at Karnak, we have a collimating axis. We
have the other end of the temple blocked; we have these
various diaphragms or pylons, so that, practically, there is
absolutely no question of principle of construction involved
in this temple that was not involved in the great solar temple
of Amen-Rā itself.</p>

<p>We made out that in the case of the temples devoted to
sun-worship and to the determination of the length of the
year, there was very good reason why all these attempts
should be made to cut off the light, by diaphragms and stone
ceilings, because, among other things, one wanted to find the
precise point occupied by the sunbeam on the two or three
days near the winter or summer solstice in order to determine
the exact moment of the solstice.</p>

<p>But if a temple is not intended to observe the sun, why
these diaphragms? Why keep the astronomer, or the priest,
so much in the dark? There is a very good reason indeed.</p>

<p>From the account given by Herodotus[42] of the ceremonials and
mysteries connected with the temple of Tyre, it is suggested
that the priests used starlight at night for some of their operations,
very much in the same way as they might have used
sunlight during the day. According to Herodotus, in the
temple in question there were two pillars&mdash;the one of pure gold,
and the other of an emerald stone of such size as to shine by
night.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Now, there can be little doubt that in the darkened
sanctuary of an Egyptian temple the light of α Lyræ, one of
the brightest stars in the northern heavens, rising in the clear
air of Egypt, would be quite strong enough to throw into an
apparent glow such highly-reflecting surfaces as those to which
Herodotus refers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162"> 162</span></p>

<p>Supposing such a ceremonial as this, the less the worshippers&mdash;who,
reasoning from the analogy of the ceremonial termed
the manifestation of Rā,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> would stand facing the sanctuary,
with their backs to the chief door of the temple&mdash;knew about
the question of a bright star which might probably produce
the mystery, the better.</p>

<p>Again, the truer the orientation of the temple to the star,
and the greater the darkness the priest was kept in, the sooner
would he catch the star quivering in the light of either early
or late dawn.</p>

<p>In the first place, the diaphragms would indicate the true
line that he had to watch; he would not have to <i>search</i> for
the star which he expected; and obviously the more he was
kept in the dark the sooner could he see the star.</p>

<p>Is there any additional line of evidence beyond the structural
conditions of the temples that the Egyptians used these
temples to observe the stars? Here a very interesting question
comes in: a temple built at one period to observe a star
could not go on for ever serving its purpose, for the reason
that the declination of the star must change, as we have seen,
by precession. Therefore a temple built with a particular
amplitude to observe a particular star at one period would
be useless later on.</p>

<p>We have here possibly a means of testing whether or not
any of these temples were used to observe the stars. In those
very early days, 3000 or 4000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, we must assume that
the people who observed the stars had not the slightest idea
of these possible precessional changes; they imagined that
they were just as safe in directing a temple to a star as they
were in directing a temple to the sun. But with a star
changing its declination in an average way, the <i>same</i> temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163"> 163</span>
could not be used to observe the <i>same</i> star for more than
200 or 300 years; so that at the end of that time, if they
still wished to observe that particular star, they must either
change the axis of the old temple, or build a new one. I
have mentioned an average time as the change of the star's
declination is involved.</p>

<p>Now this change of direction is one of the most striking
things which have been observed for years past in Egyptian
temples.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we find that the axes of the temples
have been changed, and have been freely changed; that
there has been a great deal of work done on many of the
temples which are not oriented to the sun, in order to give
them a twist.</p>

<p>Once a solar temple, a solar temple for thousands of years;
once a star temple, only <i>that</i> star temple for something like
300 years, so that the conditions were entirely changed.</p>

<p>We get cases in which the axis of a temple has had its
direction changed, and others in which, where it has been
difficult or impossible to make the change in a temple, the
change of amplitude has been met by putting up a new temple
altogether. We are justified in considering such temples as
a series in which, instead of changing the orientation of a
pre-existing temple, a new temple has been built to meet the
new condition of things. That, I think, is a suggestion
which we are justified in making to Egyptologists on astronomical
grounds.</p>

<p>For an instance, I may refer to the well-known temple at
Medînet-Habû. We have there two temples side by side&mdash;a
large temple, which was built later, with its systems of
pylons and sanctuaries; a smaller temple, with outside courts,
and, again, a sanctuary built much earlier. The direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164"> 164</span>
of these two temples is very different;
there is a difference of several degrees.
It is very difficult indeed to understand
why these two structures should have
been built in that way if there were
not some good reason for it. The
best hitherto found is the supposed
symmetrophobia of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>We find the same thing in Greece.
There is the old Parthenon, a building
which may have been standing
at the time of the Trojan
war, and the new Parthenon,
with an outer court
very like the Egyptian
temples, but with its sanctuary
more nearly in the
centre of the building. It
was by the difference of
direction of these two
temples at Athens that my
attention was called to the
subject.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166"> 166</span></p>

<p>If we study the orientation
of these, we find
that, like those at Medînet-Habû,
they are not parallel;
there is a difference of
orientation. This method
of coping with the changes
of amplitude of the star
apparently represents that
adopted where there has been ample space to build another
temple by the side of the old one when the star could no longer
be seen from end to end of the old one. But another way
was found where the space was more circumscribed, and that
is well represented by the temple at Luxor, in which the
addition is made <i>end on</i>. The suggestion is that, after the
temple at Luxor had been built a certain number of years,
the amplitude of the star had got a little out of the initial
line, and the direction was changed at the time when it was
determined to make the temple more beautiful and to amplify
it by adding an outer court. There is another outer court and
another very considerable change. There are four well-marked
deviations.</p>

<small>FURTHER INQUIRIES WITH REGARD TO THE STELLAR TEMPLES.</small></h2></div>


<p>In the preceding chapter I discussed the suggestion, quite
independently of any records the Egyptians may have left
on the subject, that certain of the temples were oriented to
stars; and I applied one test, that, namely, of the change of
direction which was imperative if stars were observed for any
lengthened period. In such an inquiry we must proceed with
great caution.</p>

<p>We cannot make a statement regarding every particular
temple with absolute certainty, for the reason that in the case
of most of the temples the best Egyptologists cannot give us
the most precious piece of information which we require from
the astronomical point of view&mdash;that is, the date of the <i>foundation</i>
of the temple. If in the case of these temples it were
absolutely certain that each temple was built at a certain time
with a certain orientation, we could tell at once whether or
not that temple was pointed to any particular star.</p>

<p>In the absence of this precise information a general attack
on the question has been necessary. The method adopted
in the search has been as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) To tabulate the orientations of some of the chief
temples described by the French Commission, by Lepsius
and others.</p>

<p>Several interesting facts were soon revealed by this
tabulation.</p>

<p>The first point that I have to note is that, in the case of
some of these temples, we get the same, or nearly the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168"> 168</span>
amplitudes in different localities. To show this clearly it will
be convenient to compare together the chief temples near Karnak
and those having the same amplitudes elsewhere. We can do
this by laying down along a circle the different amplitudes to
which these various temples point. To begin with and to
make the story complete, I draw attention to the temples which
we have already discussed with an amplitude of 27°, or 26°, at
Thebes, Karnak, and elsewhere. These, of course, are solar
temples. Next we have non-solar amplitudes at Karnak and
Thebes, associated with temples having the same amplitude at
Denderah, Annu, and other places.</p>

<p>Another point is that we have the majority of the non-solar
temples removed just as far as they can be in amplitude from
the solar ones, for the reason that they are as nearly as possible
<i>at right angles</i> to them, so that if the sun were observed in one
temple and a star in the other, there would be a difference of
90° between the position of the sun and the position of the star
at that moment. This would, of course, apply also to two stars.
Sometimes this rectangular arrangement is in the same temple,
as at Karnak, sometimes in an adjacent one, as at Denderah.</p>

<p>If we study Denderah we find that we have there a large
temple enclosed in a square <i>temenos</i> wall, the sides of which are
parallel to the sides of the temple; and also a little temple at
right angles to the principal one.</p>

<p>It is hardly fair to say that a rectangular arrangement,
repeated in different localities, is accidental; it is one which is
used to some extent in our modern observatories.</p>

<p>The perpetual recurrence of these rectangular temples
shows, I think, that there was some definite view in the minds
of those who built all the pairs of temples which are thus
related to each other; what that view was I shall endeavour to
discuss in the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169"> 169</span></p>

<p>A third circumstance is that, when we get some temples
pointing a certain number of degrees south of east, we get
other temples pointing the same number of degrees south of
west, so that some temples may have been used to observe
risings and others settings of stars in the same declination. It
is then natural, of course, to suggest that these temples were
arranged to observe the rising and setting of the same stars;
but further inquiry has shown that there are mythological
objections to this explanation.</p>

<p>Finally, we have temples with the same amplitudes high
north and high south, in different places&mdash;temples which could
not have been built with reference to the sun; just as we have
at different places temples with the same amplitudes which
<i>could</i> have been used for solar purposes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(2) To extend and check some of these observations with
special reference to my new point of view in Egypt itself.</p>

<p>In connection with the possible astronomical uses of these
temples, I find that when one of the temples has been built,
the horizon has always been very carefully left open; there has
always been a possibility of vision along the collimating axis
prolonged. Lines of sphinxes have been broken to ensure this;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
at Medînet-Habû, on the opposite side of the river to Karnak,
we have outside this great temple a model of a Syrian fort. If
we prolong the line of the temple from the middle of the Naos
through the systems of pylons, we find that in the model of
the fort an opening was left, so that the vision from the
sanctuary of the temple was left absolutely free to command
the horizon.</p>

<p>It may be said that that cannot be true of Karnak, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"> 170</span>
we see on the general plan that one of the temples, with an
azimuth of 72½°N., had its collimating axis blocked by numerous
buildings. That is true; but when one comes to examine into
the date of these buildings, as I propose to do in a subsequent
chapter, it is found that they are all very late; whereas there
is evidence that the temple in question was one of the first, if
not the very first, of the temples built at Thebes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(3) To determine the declinations to which the various
amplitudes correspond. In this direction I have made use of
the German Catalogue of star places from 1800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> to 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
the places for dates beyond this, and for southern stars, having
been calculated chiefly by my son, Mr. W. J. S. Lockyer, B.A.</p>

<p>Some places for Sirius and Canopus have been obligingly
placed at my disposal by Mr. Hind, and approximate values
obtained by the use of a precessional globe constructed for me by
Mr. Newton. This globe differs considerably from that previously
contrived by M. Biot, about which I was ignorant when
I began the work, and enables right ascensions and declinations,
but especially the latter, to be determined with a fair amount
of accuracy for forty-eight equidistant points occupied by the
pole of the equator round the pole of the ecliptic (assumed to
be fixed) in the precessional revolution.</p>

<p>Some simple astronomical considerations may here come to
our help. If the north polar distance of a star is increasing&mdash;that
is, if a star is increasing its distance from the north pole&mdash;its
declination if north or south will be decreased or increased
respectively, and the orientation of the temple would be gradually
becoming more and more parallel to an E. and W. line; if
the declination north or south of the star be increasing, then the
orientation of the temple would have to be likewise increased.
The change in the orientation, therefore, gives us information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171"> 171</span>
towards determining in which quarter of the heavens each
particular star might have been.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(4) In cases where the date of the foundation of a temple
dedicated to a particular divinity has been thoroughly known,
there was no difficulty in finding the star the declination of
which at the time would give the amplitude; and, in the case
of series of temples dedicated to the same divinity, an
additional check was afforded if the changes of amplitude
from the latest to the newest temple agreed with the changes
of the declinations of the same star.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(5) Having the declinations of the stars thus determined
for certain epochs, I have next plotted them on curves, showing
the amplitude for any year up to 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at Thebes for a true
horizon and when the horizon is raised 1° or 2° by hills or mist;
and, finally, a table has been prepared showing the declination
proper to the amplitude of each of the chief temples when the
needful information was available.</p>

<p>Although, however, these matters can be discussed in a way
that will indicate that the inquiry is raised, I do not wish for
one moment to speak of it as being settled, because the observations
which have been made already in Egypt with regard to
the orientation of these temples have not been made from such
a very special point of view; and, further, considerable alteration
in the amplitude would be made by the presence of even a low
range of hills miles away in the case of stars rising or setting
not many degrees from the north or south. No one would
care to make the assertion with absolute definiteness until it
was known whether or not the horizon in each case was interfered
with by hills or any intervening objects&mdash;was or was not
one, in fact, which might be regarded as a sea horizon from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172"> 172</span>
point of observation; if there were impediments, the angular
height of them must, of course, be exactly known; but this
information is almost entirely lacking.</p>

<p>Now, however, that the question has been raised by observations
of the temples themselves, it becomes interesting to ask
of the inscriptions if there are records that these temples were
directed to stars?</p>

<p>It will be seen in the next chapter that the inscriptions give
out no uncertain sound on this point.</p>

<small>THE BUILDING INSCRIPTIONS.</small></h2></div>


<p>Numerous references to the ceremonial of laying the foundation-stones
of temples exist, and we learn from the works of
Chabas, Brugsch, Dümichen,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and others, that the foundation
of an Egyptian temple was associated with a series of
ceremonies which are repeatedly described with a minuteness
which, as Nissen has pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is painfully wanting in the
case of Greece and Rome. Amongst these ceremonies, one
especially refers to the fixing of the temple-axis; it is called,
technically, "the stretching of the cord," and is not only
illustrated by inscriptions on the walls of the temples of
Karnak, Denderah, and Edfû&mdash;to mention the best-known
cases&mdash;but is referred to elsewhere.</p>

<p>Another part of the ceremony consisted in the king proceeding
to the site where the temple was to be built,
accompanied mythically by the goddess Sesheta, who is
styled "the mistress of the laying of the foundation-stone."</p>

<p>Each was armed with a stake. The two stakes were connected
by a cord. Next the cord was aligned towards the
sun or star, as the case might be; when the alignment was
perfect the two stakes were driven into the ground by means
of a wooden mallet; there was no difference of procedure in
the case of temples directed to the sun. One boundary wall
parallel to the main axis of the temple was built along the
line marked out by this stretched cord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174"> 174</span></p>

<p>If the moment of sun&mdash;or star-rise or&mdash;set were chosen, as we
have every reason to believe was the case seeing that all the
early observations were made on the horizon, it is obvious
that the light from the body towards which the temple was
aligned would penetrate the axis of the temple thus built from
one end to the other in the original direction of the cord.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_p174" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p174.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION-STONE CEREMONIAL.</div>
</div>

<p>We learn from Chabas that the Egyptian word which
expresses the idea of founding or laying the foundation-stone
of a temple is <i>Senti</i>&mdash;a word which still exists in Coptic. But
in the old language another word, <i>Put-ser</i>, which no longer
remains in Coptic, has been traced. It has been established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175"> 175</span>
that <i>put</i> means "to stretch," and <i>ser</i> means "cord;" so that that
part of the ceremonial which consisted in stretching a cord in
the direction of a star was considered of so great an importance
that it gave its name to the whole ceremonial.</p>

<p>I will next refer to some of the inscriptions; one, dating
from the last half of the third thousand B.C., occurs in the
document describing the building of the temple of Annu
(Heliopolis). We read:&mdash;"Arose the king, attired in his
necklace and the feather crown; all the world followed him,
and the majesty of Amenemhāt [first king of the Twelfth
dynasty]. The Kher-heb read the sacred text during the
stretching of the measuring-cord and the laying of the foundation-stone
on the piece of ground selected for this temple.
Then withdrew His Majesty Amenemhāt; and King Usertsen
[son and co-regent] wrote it down before the people."</p>

<p>Nissen, from whom (<i>loc. cit.</i>) I quote the above, adds:&mdash;"On
account of the stretching of the measuring-cord, the
Egyptian engineers were called by the Greeks ἁρπεδονάπται whose art Democritus boasts of having acquired."</p>

<p>We next turn to Abydos, possibly one of the oldest temple-fields
in Egypt. There is an inscription relating to the
rebuilding of one of them in the time of Seti I. (about 1380
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). In this the goddess Sesheta addresses the king as
follows:&mdash;"The hammer in my hand was of gold, as I struck
the peg with it, and thou wast with me in thy capacity of
Harpedonapt. Thy hand held the spade during the fixing
of its [the temple's] four corners with accuracy by the four
supports of heaven." On the pictures the king appears with
the Osiris crown, opposite the goddess. Both hold in their right
hand a club, and with it they each hammer a long peg into
the ground. Round the two pegs runs a rope, which is
stretched tight, the ends being tied together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176"> 176</span></p>

<p>In two cases the star used for the alignment is actually
named. Of these I will take, first, the record of the ceremony
used in the building of the temple of Hathor at Denderah.</p>


<p class="center">THE ALIGNMENT OF THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDERAH.</p>

<p>The inscriptions state that the king while stretching the
cord had his glance directed to the <i>āk</i> of the constellation of
the <i>Thigh</i>&mdash;the old name of the constellation which we now
recognise as the Great Bear&mdash;and on this line was built the new
temple, "as had been done there before."</p>

<p>The actual inscription has been translated as follows:&mdash;"The
living God, the magnificent son of Asti [a name of
Thoth], nourished by the sublime goddess in the temple, the
sovereign of the country, stretches the rope in joy. With his
glance towards the <i>āk</i> [the middle?] of the Bull's Thigh
constellation, he establishes the temple-house of the mistress
of Denderah, as took place there before." At another place
the king says: "Looking to the sky at the course of the rising
stars [and] recognising the <i>āk</i> of the Bull's Thigh constellation,
I establish the corners of the temple of Her Majesty."</p>

<p>Here, then, we have more than evidence of the stretching
of a cord towards a star; an actual constellation is named,
and it may be easily imagined that in connection with this
many interesting questions arise of the utmost importance to
the subject we are considering.</p>

<p>Dümichen, in his references to this passage, discusses the
meaning of the word <i>āk</i> in relation to some Theban grave-inscriptions,
in which it is suggested that <i>āk</i> is used to
represent the middle course of a star, or, astronomically
speaking, its culminating point as it passes the meridian. But
such a meaning as this will never do in this connection; for if
a cord was stretched towards a star on the meridian it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177"> 177</span>
lie north and south, and therefore the temple would be built
north and south. But this is by no means the orientation of
the temple&mdash;a point to which I shall return presently.</p>

<p>But it may be suggested that the word <i>āk</i>, used in relation
to the king's observation, more probably referred to the
brightest star, Dubhe (α Ursæ Majoris) in the asterism, or the
"middle point" of the constellation, which would be about
represented by the star δ, which lies nearly in the centre of
the modern constellation of the Great Bear, supposing, indeed,
that the same stars were included in the old constellation.
On this point we unfortunately have no definite knowledge,
as the Thigh is so variously represented; sometimes there is
a hind-quarter, represented evidently by the well-known seven
stars; at others the body of a cow (with horns and disk) is
attached.</p>

<p>However this may be, without such a reference to some
particular part of the constellation it is obvious that the
stretched cord may have had a most indeterminate direction.</p>

<p>In order to leave no stone unturned in attempting to
explain this description&mdash;supposing it to represent an undoubted
fact of observation&mdash;we may consider another
possible interpretation of the word <i>āk</i>. The amplitude of
the temple being 71½° N. of E., shows conclusively that we
cannot be dealing with the meridian, but may we be dealing
with the most eastern elongation of the star in its journey
round the Pole?</p>

<p>I have inquired into this matter for the time of the last
building of the temple in the time of the Ptolemies, and find
that the amplitude of the temple, instead of being 71½°, would
have been about 70°. It seems probable, then, that this
interpretation will not hold, and it may be further stated that,
in the case of a star at a considerable angle above the horizon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178"> 178</span>
the stretching of a cord in the building ceremonial&mdash;the
"Ausspannung der Strickes," as the words <i>put-ser</i> are translated
by Dümichen&mdash;would really have been no stretching of the
cord at all; for the star being many degrees above the horizon,
another method must have been employed, and in all probability
would have been distinctly referred to in the careful
statements of the ceremonies which exist, I think, then, that
we are perhaps justified in dismissing this possible explanation,
especially as rising stars are referred to.</p>

<p>We now come to considerations of a different order. The
inscription which we have quoted is put into the mouth of the
Emperor Augustus, though he never was at Denderah.</p>

<p>This suggests that the temple built in the time of Augustus
carried forward the account of the old foundation. There
is evidence of this. The constellation of the Thigh neither
rose nor set in the time of Augustus&mdash;it was circumpolar.
The same statement may be made regarding the restoration
in the time of Thothmes III. So we are driven to the conclusion
that if we regard the inscription as true, it must refer
to a time preceding the reign of Thothmes. I shall return to
this subject in a subsequent chapter.</p>


<p class="center">THE ALIGNMENT OF THE TEMPLE OF EDFÛ.</p>

<p>A reference to the same constellation (the Thigh) is also
made in the account of the ceremonial used at the laying of
the foundation-stone of the temple at Edfû. The king's
glance was directed&mdash;in the case of the building of that temple&mdash;to
the <i>Thigh</i>, but no precise reference to any star or to any
point <i>āk</i> is given.</p>

<p>As before, I give the full translation of the inscription,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
remarking that the last restoration was made <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 237-57.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179"> 179</span>
The king is represented as speaking thus:&mdash;"I have grasped
the wooden peg and the handle of the club; I hold the rope
with Sesheta; my glance follows the course of the stars; my
eye is on Mesχet [that is, the 'Bull's Thigh constellation,' or
Great Bear]; (mine the part of time of the number of the
hour-clock); I establish the corners of thy house of God." And
in another place:&mdash;"I have grasped the wooden peg; I hold
the handle of the club; I grasp the cord with Sesheta; I cast
my face towards the course of the rising constellations; I let
my glance enter the constellation of the Great Bear (the part
of my time stands in the place of his hour-clock); I establish
the four corners of thy temple." The translation is Brugsch's.
The phrases in parentheses are interpreted differently by
Dümichen, who translates them:&mdash;"Standing as divider of
time by his measuring instrument," or "representing the
divider of time (<i>i.e.</i> the god Thoth) at his measuring instrument."
The word <i>merech</i> or <i>merchet</i>, in which Brugsch
suspects hour-or water-clock, does not occur elsewhere.</p>

<p>In this case, seeing that the temple lies with its axis very
nearly north and south, as I determined by my own (magnetic)
observations, the stretching of the cord was certainly in or
very near the meridian; and it may be remarked that in the
Naos there is an opening in the roof, over the side of the
second or third door from the sanctuary, and inclined at an
angle of 40° (unlike any other opening that I have seen in the
roof of any Egyptian temple), which may have been used to
observe the transit of some particular star. The angle I was
not able to determine with absolute accuracy, as the vertical
circle of the theodolite I had with me was out of adjustment.</p>

<p>Taking the latitude of Edfû as 25°, and assuming the
angle of 40° to be not far from the truth, the North Polar
distance of the star observed would be 15°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180"> 180</span></p>

<p>Within a degree or so&mdash;and this is as near as we can get
till more accurate observations have been made on the spot&mdash;this
satisfies Dubhe, the chief star in the Great Bear in the
time of the Ptolemies. Supposing the temple was originally
oriented to Dubhe, its amplitude, 86½° S. of W., gives us the
date 3900 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> I shall show, however, that it is more probable
that the temple was oriented on some southern star.</p>

<p>I may here remark that, so far as I know, Edfû is the temple
in Egypt nearest the meridian. If, therefore, it were used
as, on my theory, all other temples were, it could only have
picked up the light from each of the southerly stars, as by
the precessional movements they were brought into visibility
very near the southern horizon.</p>

<p>In this respect, then, it is truly a temple of Horns, in
relation to the southern stars&mdash;the southern eyes of Horus.
But it was not a sun-temple in the sense that Karnak was
one; and if ceremonies were performed for which light was
required, perhaps the apparatus referred to by the writer
Dupuis<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was utilised. He mentions that in a temple at
Heliopolis&mdash;whether a solar temple or not is not stated&mdash;the
temple was flooded all day long with sunlight by means of
a mirror. I do not know the authorities on which Dupuis
founds his statement, but I have no doubt that it is amply
justified, for the reason that doubtless all the inscriptions in
the deepest tombs were made by means of reflected sunlight,
for in all freshly-opened tombs there are no traces whatever of
any kind of combustion having taken place, even in the inner-most
recesses. So strikingly evident is this that my friend
M. Bouriant, while we were discussing this matter at Thebes,
laughingly suggested the possibility that the electric light was
known to the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181"> 181</span></p>

<p>With a system of fixed mirrors inside the galleries, whatever
their length, and a movable mirror outside to follow the
course of an Egyptian sun and reflect its beams inside, it would
be possible to keep up a constant illumination in any part of
the galleries, however remote.</p>

<p>Dupuis quotes another statement that the greatest precautions
were taken that the first rays of sunlight should enter
a temple (of course, he means a solar temple).</p>

<p>But it is possible that there might have been another temple
at right angles, facing nearly due east. In this case, the larger
temple would have been named after the worship to which the
smaller one was dedicated. If so, unlike the solar temples at
Heliopolis, Abydos, and Thebes, the Edfû temple was sacred
to the Equinoctial Sun, or, at all events, to the Sun very near
an equinox.</p>

<small>THE STAR-TEMPLES AT KARNAK.</small></h2></div>


<p>When I began my studies of the Egyptian temples the
building inscriptions referred to in the preceding chapter
lay forgotten in the Egyptologist's archives. I purpose now
to give some account of my work at Thebes, where I made
a special study of the temples, because there is a very great
number there, and many are in a fair state of preservation.
These investigations convinced me that temples were oriented
to stars before the inscriptions in question were known to
me, although the whole temple field is so crowded with
temples, each apparently blocking up the fair-way of the
other, that it seems well-nigh impossible that any such process
as that described in the last chapter could have been
applied.</p>

<p>This difficulty will be gathered from the accompanying
folding plate giving a reproduction of Lepsius's general maps
of the temple region of Karnak, showing his reference letters
and also the <i>true</i> north and the orientation of the chief temples.
We have already dealt with the solar temple of Amen-Rā.</p>

<p>We find, beginning at the south, a large temple with
a long line of sphinxes, the temple of Mut (<span class="allsmcap">X</span>) facing the
large temple of Amen-Rā (<span class="allsmcap">K</span>). To the north of the latter
is another temple system (<span class="allsmcap">A</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B</span> and <span class="allsmcap">C</span>), also with an
avenue of sphinxes. On the east side of <span class="allsmcap">K</span> another temple
(<span class="allsmcap">O</span>) is only slightly indicated.</p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF THE TEMPLES AT KARNAK (FROM LEPSIUS), FOLLOWING THEIR ORIENTATIONS.</div>
</div>


<p>To the south of the large temple <span class="allsmcap">K</span> is another one&mdash;that
of Khons (<span class="allsmcap">T</span>), also with its sphinxes. Connected with <span class="allsmcap">K</span> are
two other temples, <span class="allsmcap">L</span>, nearly, and <span class="allsmcap">M</span>, exactly, at right angles
to it. There is also such a rectangular temple (<span class="allsmcap">Y</span>) added
to the temple of Mut. I also call attention to the temples
<span class="allsmcap">V</span> and <span class="allsmcap">W</span>, chiefly to point out that when I went over the
ground with M. Bouriant it seemed to us as if the temple <span class="allsmcap">V</span>
faced S.E. and not N.W. as indicated by Lepsius. Very few
traces of the temple are left.</p>

<p>Since the labours of the French and Prussian Governments
gave full records of Karnak a memoir on the temples
has been published by Mariette, which gives us not only
plans, but precious information relating to the periods at
which, and the kings by whom, the various parts of the
temples were constructed or modified. No doubt those which
are still traceable form only a very small portion of those
which once existed; but however that may be, I have now
only to call attention to some among them.</p>

<p>I have previously shown that the magnificent work of
Mariette has supplied us with building dates for the solar
temple to which reference has been made; so that we have,
with more or less accuracy, the sequence of the various parts
of the completed building.</p>

<p>If we consider the plan without any reference to the building
dates at all, the idea that the smaller temples were built
for observations of stars seems to be entirely discountenanced.
The temple <span class="allsmcap">L</span>, for instance, instead of having a clear horizon,
is blocked by the very solid wall (2) and its accompanying
columns; the temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span>, instead of having a clear horizon, is
absolutely blocked by two of the line of pillars (1) very carefully
built in front of it. But if we consult Mariette, <i>we find in
both cases that the wall was built long after one temple, and the
pillars were built long after the other</i>.</p>

<p>This result is satisfactory, inasmuch as it indicates that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184"> 184</span>
a natural objection to the orientation hypothesis is invalid.
But can we strengthen it by supporting Mariette's statement
as to the dates?</p>

<p>Mariette states that the temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span> was built by Rameses
III., a king of the twentieth dynasty. With this datum,
we consider the orientation of the temple. The problem is one
of this kind:&mdash;Taking the Egyptologist's date for Rameses
III. at 1200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and taking the amplitude of the temple
as 63½° N. of E., was there, when that temple was built,
any star opposite to it, any star to which it accurately
pointed? We can translate the amplitude of that temple
into the declination of a star, making a slight correction
for the stated conditions of observation in Egypt, which
would make the apparent amplitude less than the true one,
because the star would appear to rise more to the south.
In the absence of precise information, we are justified in
taking the mean of the values referred to by Biot&mdash;that is,
an apparent amplitude due to a stratum of haze 1½° high,
especially as the temple looked away from the Nile.</p>

<p>Searching the astronomical tables, we find that there was
a star visible along the temple axis. The star was γ Draconis.</p>

<p>So much for the temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span>. We now proceed to the other
one lettered <span class="allsmcap">L</span>, the temple of Seti II.</p>

<p>The amplitude of temple L is 63° S. of W., and the date,
according to Mariette, 1300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> We find the declination, proceeding
as before, and assuming hills 1½° high, to be 53½° S.,
and about that date the bright star Canopus set on the alignment
of the temple.</p>

<p>It will hence be gathered that just as truly as the temple
<span class="allsmcap">M</span> seems to have been pointed to the northern star γ Draconis
rising, the temple <span class="allsmcap">L</span> was pointed to the southern star Canopus,
setting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185"> 185</span></p>

<p>But this is not all. There is another temple to which I
have already directed attention&mdash;the temple of Khons (<span class="allsmcap">T</span> of
Lepsius), founded by Rameses III., though as it comes to us
it is a Ptolemaic structure, it having been enlarged and restored
by the Ptolemies. It is very nearly, but not quite,
parallel to the temple of Seti II.</p>

<p>My measures and those of Lepsius give, approximately,
amplitudes as under&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Temple of Seti (<span class="allsmcap">T</span>)  63° S. of W.</li>
<li>Temple of Khons (<span class="allsmcap">L</span>) 62°    "</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing, therefore, the same line of inquiry, and assuming
that Mariette was right, and that the temple was really
finally completed (and no doubt its axis revised) by the
Ptolemies, and that they flourished about 200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, we have
the same problem. Was there a star towards which that
temple could have been directed, and which could have been
seen in that temple with its actual orientation?</p>

<p>Calculation shows that the change of amplitude of Canopus
due to the precessional movement between 1300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and
200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is almost exactly 1°, the difference in the amplitude
of the temples. We seem, then, to have in the temples <span class="allsmcap">L</span> and <span class="allsmcap">T</span>
two temples directed to the same star at different times.</p>

<p>These statements must be taken as provisional only. To
render them absolute, careful measurements must be made, on
the spot, of the heights of the hills towards which the temples
point.</p>

<p>Leaving this for the moment on one side, we get in this
manner astronomical dates of the reigns of Seti II. and
Rameses III. within a very few years of those given by the
Egyptologists.</p>

<p>More than this, the application of this method entirely justifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186"> 186</span>
Mariette's view with regard to these more modern temples at
Thebes, and shows that when they were built the outlook was
clear, so that the building ceremonials referred to in the last
chapter might have been performed.</p>

<p>I am next anxious to point out that not only is this so, but,
accepting it, we can explain exactly why the walls and temples
and columns were erected in the sequence which Mariette
indicates. We not only know when they were built, but we
can presently understand <i>why they were built</i>.</p>

<p>The first point to which I draw attention in this matter is
the following:&mdash;Referring to the plan, we find that before the
time of Rameses III. the temple of Seti II. was right out in the
open. It thus represented just one of those external rectangular
temples which have been found at Denderah and at very many
other places in Egypt. It was one of the Egyptian ideas to
have two temples at right angles to each other. That temple,
then, stood alone. The next change seems to have been this:
The star Canopus, the setting of which it was built to watch,
was, through the processional movement to which I have referred,
no longer conveniently observed in that temple. To
obviate this the temple <span class="allsmcap">T</span> was built by Rameses III. with a
change of amplitude equivalent to the actual precessional
change of the star's declination, to carry on the observations.</p>

<p>Further, at the same time another temple (<span class="allsmcap">M</span>) was built
to observe γ Draconis. It is now easy to understand what
the 21st&mdash;a Theban&mdash;dynasty did. Seti's temple (<span class="allsmcap">L</span>) had been
superseded; the temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span> was a second rectangular temple
outside the great temple of Karnak (<span class="allsmcap">K</span>). They said to themselves:
"We will make Karnak more beautiful, and we will
extend it. We can now build walls in continuation of the
old walls, and we can build still another pylon, because
Seti's temple is no longer being used, the worship having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187"> 187</span>
been transferred to the temple of Rameses III. (Khons).
By building the northern wall we prevent the use of temple
M, sacred to our enemy Sutech."</p>

<p>I should add that the opening in the wall, in prolongation
of the axis of temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span>, is <i>not</i> directly opposite the temple <span class="allsmcap">M</span>,
but a little to the east; it was probably made later, possibly by
the twenty-second dynasty, who were Set worshippers. Again,
coming to the time of Taharqa, returning at the end of the exile
of the priests of Amen in Nubia, the temple, M was again thrown
out of use. Pillars were built in front of it, right in the fair-way,
affording an instance that when a temple was thrown out
of use, not by the precessional movement of the star to which
it had been directed, but by the partisans of another creed, the
fact of its being no longer in operation was insured by something
being built in front of it, to prevent observation of the
stellar divinity no longer in vogue.</p>

<p>It may be added that long after the temple of Seti II. fell
out of astronomical use, and was on that account blocked by
the walls of the twenty-first dynasty, the Ptolemies built
a new temple of Osiris, which, if built before, would have
been in the fair-way of the temple of Seti. Thus, there is
a reason for all the changes made at all the dates referred
to by Mariette.</p>

<p>I think we find in this result of the inquiry a valuable
corroboration of Mariette's conclusions, and another reason
why we should not cease to admire his magnificent works.</p>

<p>So far I have only referred to the relatively modern parts
of Karnak. I now pass to the more ancient ones, in which
we ought to note the same laws holding good, if there be any
value in the view we are discussing.</p>

<p>We find that some of the most important temples given by
Lepsius and Mariette (<span class="allsmcap">B</span>, <span class="allsmcap">X</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">W</span>) are just as effectively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188"> 188</span>
blocked by the mass of the temple of Amen-Rā as those
we have already considered were by the walls of the twenty-first
dynasty and Taharqa's columns; and, looking at the
plan, it seems at first perfectly absurd to continue to hold
for one moment the idea that these temples were built for
observations of stars on the horizon.</p>

<p>The temple <span class="allsmcap">X</span> (Mut) is blocked by the pylon marked
3, the temple <span class="allsmcap">B</span> by the eastern end of the great temple, the
temple <span class="allsmcap">W</span> by the temple <span class="allsmcap">O</span>.</p>

<p>Mariette here again comes to our rescue to a certain extent.
He shows, as I have stated in Chapter XI., that in the beginning
of things, certainly in the twelfth dynasty, possibly in the
eleventh dynasty, and possibly even before that, only the
central part, marked 4, of the solar temple existed, less as
a temple than as a shrine, with nothing to the west of it and
nothing to the east of it.</p>

<p>That being so, the temple <span class="allsmcap">B</span> gets its fair-way to the south,
and the temple of Mut (<span class="allsmcap">X</span>) and the smaller temple (<span class="allsmcap">W</span>) to the
north.</p>

<p>Mariette in his two plates shows the growth of the temple
of Amen-Rā in a most admirable way, from the central portion
of the temple to which I have referred&mdash;that, is, the small
central court, which, he is careful to note, existed before
Thothmes I.; how much before, he does not say. Afterwards,
the pylons are added; then they are elaborated; then the
sanctuary is thrown back to the eastward, and the temple O
built, and B thereby blocked, and then thrown forward to the
westward, thus blocking <span class="allsmcap">X</span> and <span class="allsmcap">Z</span>.</p>

<p>If there is anything in these considerations at all, it is
suggested that all the temples to which 1 have referred
were founded before these easterly and westerly extensions, of
which Mariette gives us such ample evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189"> 189</span></p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter it is suggested that this great
lengthening of the original shrine of Amen-Rā was undertaken
for the purpose of blocking temples <span class="allsmcap">X</span>, <span class="allsmcap">Z</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">W</span>, all dedicated
to Set. Thothmes III. and Taharqa had precisely the same
objects in view, apparently.</p>

<p>Here, however, we meet a real difficulty. Mariette states
that, so far as he has been able to find, the temple <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, a temple
of which the worship is Amen, and the temple <span class="allsmcap">X</span>, in which
the worship is Mut, were built by Amen-hetep III. If that
were so, they would have been built blocked; none of the
usual ceremonials could have been employed at their foundation.
They could not have been used at all for astronomical
purposes, because their horizons were blocked by these extensions
of the temple of Amen-Rā.</p>

<p>Here I must refer specially to temple <span class="allsmcap">B</span>. Its amplitude is,
according to Lepsius, 63½° S. of W. I have already shown
that the amplitudes of temples <span class="allsmcap">L</span> (Khons) and <span class="allsmcap">T</span> (Seti II.) are
62° and 63° S. of W., and that in the times of the Ptolemies
and Seti II., each faced the star Canopus in turn. Hence
the probability that we have three temples of nearly equal
orientation sacred to the same divinity.</p>

<p>The statement is that the part of the temple of Amen-Rā, the
building of which blocked <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, was commenced by Thothmes
III., whose date, according to Brugsch, is 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and continued
by Amen-hetep III. (1500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Unless, then, some
other provision was made, the observations of Canopus were
not continued until another shrine was built. We know that
another shrine was built, that of Seti II., and that its orientation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190"> 190</span>
gives a date of 1350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It might have been commenced by
Seti I. after the Khu-en-Aten troubles, and finished by Seti II.</p>

<p>One is therefore tempted to ask whether we have not here
one of those crucial cases which Mariette himself contemplated,
in which the true foundation is so far anterior to the last
restoration or the last decoration, from which, for the most
part, the archæologist gets his information, that one is absolutely
misled by the restorations or decorations as to the true
date of the original foundation of the shrine.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>If the archæologists are right in attributing the granite
temple of Osiris (?), near the sphinx, to a date anterior to, or even
contemporaneous with, the second pyramid, we have evidence
that in the early dynasties the temple building in stone, and
even in granite brought from Aswân, was as perfect in the
matter of workmanship as in the eighteenth dynasty; and that
it was not then the fashion to inscribe walls, but only statues
and stelas. May it possibly be that the fashion in question
came in, or reached its greatest development, during the
eighteenth dynasty, and that on this account so many temples
are ascribed to that period, whereas they were actually in
existence before?</p>

<p>If the prior dynasties built no temples, why did they not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191"> 191</span>
do so? and if they did, where are they, if some of those
<i>inscribed</i> by the eighteenth dynasty be not they?</p>

<p>In the absence of final archæological evidence&mdash;that is,
admitting Mariette's own doubt as to the mere existence of
inscriptions&mdash;are there any astronomical considerations which
may possibly help us? Assuming that the temples were
astronomically oriented, we have <i>one</i> registering for us the
time elapsed since the original direction of the axis was laid
down, in terms of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>We have others registering time in like manner in terms
of the change due to precession, if we can get any light as
to the stars towards which the temples were oriented.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with the temple of Amen-Rā in
Chapter XI., and we found a foundation date of 3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> for
the original shrine, so far as the rough observations already
available can be trusted. Assuming the accuracy of this determination,
it is clear that we must look for stars with appropriate
amplitudes between that date and say 2500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Let us take the temple of Mut (<span class="allsmcap">X</span> of Lepsius); its amplitude
is 72½ N. of E. This was the amplitude of γ Draconis about
3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This temple, then, bore the same relation to <span class="allsmcap">M</span> as
<span class="allsmcap">T</span> did to <span class="allsmcap">L</span>! We have two cases of two temples erected at
different dates to the same star.</p>

<p>Although it has been convenient to begin with Thebes
for the reasons given, the records concerning any one temple
there are far more restricted than those which relate to some
temples elsewhere; while the cult can only be determined in
few instances. I propose, therefore, for the present to content
myself with the above general considerations showing the first
application of the method of investigation adopted, and to pass
on to Denderah, where we are sure of the cult and where many
particulars are given.</p>

<small>THE PERSONIFICATION OF STARS&mdash;THE TEMPLE OF ISIS
AT DENDERAH.</small></h2></div>


<p>We have now to pass from the building ceremonials and
a general consideration of the temples at Karnak, to the
worships to which the various temples were dedicated. And to
do this we must face the problems of Egyptian mythology, so
far as the names and origins of the various gods and goddesses
are concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p192" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p192.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">PLAN OF DENDERAH. (<i>Mariette.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>There is ample evidence that each temple was sacred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193"> 193</span>
some god or goddess, although in many cases the name of the
patron divinity has been lost.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at Denderah the patron divinities are well
known, so it will be well to begin with the temples there. We
find a general plan of Denderah among the magnificent
drawings which we owe to the French expedition of 1798.
This shows the wall round the temple-space containing the
temple of Hathor, the great temple; and the smaller temple of
Isis at right angles to it. We find, roughly, that the great
temple points to the north-east; the smaller temple of Isis
points to the south-east. A later plan has been published by
Mariette in his work on Denderah.</p>

<p>These, then, are the main conditions of the temples at
Denderah. But we can go a little more closely into them by
referring to the map which accompanies Biot's memoir, to
which I have previously referred. He gives the axis of the
Hathor temple pointing, not merely to the north-east, but to
18° E. of N. Since the other temple lies at right angles to the
great one, its direction, according to Biot, is 18° S. of E.</p>

<p>To show the uncertainty in these inquiries brought about
by the absence of a proper survey, I may give the following
later values:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194"> 194</span></p>

<p>As my value agrees closely with that of Biot, I adhere
to it; and it gives, for the amplitude of the temple of Isis
at right angles to the Hathor temple, 18½° S. of E.</p>

<p>Now, it is stated distinctly in the inscriptions that "the
place of the birth of Isis is to the north-west of the temple of
Hathor, its portal is turned to the east, and the sun shines on
its portal when it rises to illuminate the world."<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> We learn
from this that the small temple was locally celebrated as the
birthplace of Isis.</p>

<p>It is, then, a temple of Isis. Who was Isis?</p>

<p>Let us begin by considering the temple, remarking that
the inscriptions, apparently relating to both temples, are found
in one only. On this point, I, for the present, content myself
with quoting Plutarch's statement<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that Isis and Hathor were
the same divinities&mdash;at all events, in later Egyptian times.</p>

<p>If we study the inscriptions&mdash;and this, thanks chiefly to
Mariette's magnificent book on Denderah, we can do&mdash;we find
that they give out a very certain sound. Here is one of
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She [<i>i.e.</i> her Majesty Isis] shines into her temple on New Year's Day, and
she mingles her light with that of her father Rā on the horizon."</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have nothing more nor less than a distinct and
perfectly accurate statement relating to the cosmical rising of
a star, <i>i.e.</i>, as I have before explained, of the sun and the star
both rising at the same instant of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195"> 195</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p195" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p195.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">RUINS OF THE MAMISI (PLACE OF BIRTH) OR TEMPLE OF ISIS AT DENDERAH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196"> 196</span></p>

<p>Further, in the inscriptions the "<i>rising of Hathor</i>" is
mentioned distinctly. "La grande déesse Sefekh [Sesheta]
apporté les écrits qui se rapportent à ton lever, ô Hathor, et au
lever de Rā."<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Everybody knows that "Rā" means the sun, and
therefore the rising of Rā is at once accepted by everybody as
obviously meaning sunrise. But if we find "Hathor" treated
in the same way as the sun, then Hathor must be a celestial
body rising like the sun. I consider this a very important
conclusion to arrive at, for many reasons.</p>

<p>But, further, Hathor was also worshipped, according to the
inscriptions,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> under the name of Sothis.</p>

<p>Now we know, quite independently of all mythology, that
Sothis is simply the Greek form of the Egyptian name (Sept)
of the star Sirius.</p>

<p>Taking, then, all these inscriptions together, we have
an absolute astronomical demonstration of the fact that the
"rising of Hathor," which is referred to mythologically in
the inscriptions given by Mariette, was the rising of Sirius;
that the star which "shone into the temple, and which mingled
her light with the light of her father Rā," was really the
star Sirius. We get the demonstration of the fact that mythologically
the star Sirius was Hathor, or otherwise Isis.</p>

<p>In other words, we find a star personified; Sirius being
personified as Hathor or Isis.</p>

<p>But we can go much further than this. It is possible, as
I have shown, to determine the position of Sirius in past times,
and therefore to determine whether the light of that star
ever did fall along the axis of the temple. We know its
orientation approximately&mdash;18½° S. of E.&mdash;so that any celestial
body which rose at that amplitude would shine upon any object
enshrined in the sanctuary. In the case of Sirius, the
conditions are such that, owing to the precessional movement,
the distance of the star from the equator has been gradually
lessening from the earliest times. Its declination in 8000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
was 50° S.; it became something more than 17° S. in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197"> 197</span></p>

<p>Knowing the declination, it is easy to determine the
amplitude&mdash;and given the conditions at the temple of Isis at
Denderah, viz., that we are practically dealing with a sea
horizon, we find that the temple really pointed to Sirius
about 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, which is the date Biot found for the construction
of the zodiac in the temple of Osiris, referred to in
Chapter XIII.</p>

<p>Further, it is easy to show that Sirius at that date rose
with the sun on the Egyptian New Year's Day;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in mythological
language, she mingled her light with that of her
father Rā on the great day of the year.</p>

<p>As this is the first instance of such personification that
we have come across, it behoves us to study it very carefully.
Why was Sirius personified and worshipped?</p>

<p>The summer solstice&mdash;that is, the 20th of June, the longest
day&mdash;was the most important time of the Egyptian year, as it
marked the rise of the all-fertilising Nile. It was really New
Year's Day. It has been pointed out, times without number,
that the inscriptions indicate that by far the most important
astronomical event in Egyptian history was the rising of the
star Sirius at this precise time.</p>

<p>Now it seems as if among all ancient peoples each sunrise,
each return of the sun&mdash;or of the sun-god&mdash;was hailed, and
most naturally, as a resurrection from the sleep&mdash;the death&mdash;of
night: with the returning sun, man found himself again in full
possession of his powers of living, of doing, of enjoying. The
sun-god had conquered death; man was again alive. Light and
warmth returned with the dawn in those favoured Eastern
climes where man then was, and the dawn itself was a sight, a
sensation, in which everything conspired to suggest awe and
gratitude, and to thrill the emotions of even uncivilised man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198"> 198</span></p>

<p>What wonder, then, that sunrise was the chief time of
prayer and thankfulness? But prayer to the sun-god meant,
then, sacrifice; and here a practical detail comes in, apparently
a note of discord, but really the true germ of our present
knowledge of the starry heavens which surround us.</p>

<p>To make the sacrifice at the instant of sunrise, preparations
had to be made, beasts had to be slaughtered, and a ritual had
to be followed; this required time, and a certain definite
quantity of it. To measure this, the only means available then
was to watch the rising of a star, the first glimmer of which
past experience had shown to precede sunrise by just that
amount of time which the ritual demanded for the various
functions connected with the sunrise sacrifice.</p>

<p>This, perhaps, went on every morning, but beyond all
question the most solemn ceremonial of this nature in the whole
year was that which took place on New Year's morning, or the
great festival of the Nile-rising and summer solstice, the 1st of
Thoth. Besides the morning ceremonial there were processions
of the gods during the day.</p>

<p>How long these morning and special yearly ceremonials
went on before the dawn of history we, of course, have no
knowledge. Nor are the stars thus used certainly known to us.
Of course any star would do which rose at the appropriate time
before the sun itself, whether the star was located in the northern
or in the southern heavens. But in historic times there is
no doubt whatever about the star so used. The warning-star
watched by the Egyptians at Thebes, certainly 3000 B.C., was
Sirius, the brightest of them all, and there is complete evidence
that Sirius was not the star first so used.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200"> 200</span></p>

<p>The astronomical conditions of the rising of this star have,
fortunately for us, been most minutely studied both by Biot
and, in more recent times, by Oppolzer, and from their
labours it seems to be abundantly clear that the rising of Sirius
at the solstice was carefully watched certainly as early as
3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, according to Biot's calculations; and, further, that
the rising of the same star was still studied in a relatively
modern time. At the earlier date its heliacal rising was
observed, but in later times means had been secured of noticing
its cosmical rising, because although it rose long before the sun
on the longest day 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it rose <i>with</i> the sun on the same
day in the later times referred to. This "cosmical rising"
observation was doubtless secured by the construction of their
temples, as I have shown.</p>

<p>We are, then, astronomically on very firm ground indeed.
We have got one step into the domain of mythology. I
assume it is agreed that we have arrived at the certain
conclusion that the goddess Hathor or Isis personified a star,
Sirius, rising at the dawn; and that the temple of Isis at
Denderah was built to watch it.</p>

<small>THE PERSONIFICATION OF STARS (CONTINUED)&mdash;THE TEMPLE OF
HATHOR AT DENDERAH.</small></h2></div>


<p>In Chapter XVII. I quoted from the inscriptions relating
to the alignment of the axis of the temple of Hathor at
Denderah. It will be remembered that the king, while
stretching the cord, had his glance directed to the <i>āk</i> of
the constellation of the Thigh. Further, we saw in the last
chapter that the amplitude of the temple axis is 71½° N. of E.</p>

<p>A copy of Biot's plan giving his value of the orientation
is given on the next page.</p>

<p>I have shown how truly the temple of Isis was pointed
to Sirius. We have now to try to find a star towards which
the temple of Hathor may have been pointed in like manner.</p>

<p>It will be generally understood that in an inquiry of this
kind there are very many difficulties, chiefly depending upon
the uncertainty of the building-date of the original foundation,
and upon the indeterminate nature of the information available.
But although we meet with these difficulties in the case
of the temple of Hathor, there are many from which we are
free. In the case of many of the temples in Egypt we have
no knowledge of the tutelary divinity. For a great many
temples no observational data exist; they have not been
properly measured&mdash;that is, we do not know exactly in what
direction they point or what their amplitudes are; and, further
we do not know anything of the horizon at the temple building,
so as to be able to make the necessary corrections due to
heights of hills.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202"> 202</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p202" style="max-width: 75em;">

  <div class="caption">ORIENTATION OF THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDERAH (BIOT). (THE TEMPLE OF OSIRIS ON THE ROOF IS ALSO SHOWN ON A LARGER SCALE.)</div>
</div>

<p>This premised, I will now return to the statement
regarding the temple of Hathor, to see what can be made
of it on the view that either the middle or the chief point,
that is, the brightest star, of the constellation of the Great Bear
as we now know it, was the one referred to, and that the cord
was stretched to the star on the horizon.</p>

<p>The first question which arises is, Was there any reason
why δ Ursæ Majoris at the centre, or α the brightest, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203"> 203</span>
have been used as the orientation point at any time? Was
there any reason why any special sanctity should have been
associated with either? Certainly not, in the case of δ, on
account of its magnitude, because Dubhe, not far from it, is
much brighter; and possibly not, in the case both of δ and
α, on account of the time of their heliacal rising. We seem
therefore in an <i>impasse</i> along this line of inquiry; but a further
consideration of the question brings out the remarkable fact
that at three widely-sundered points of time the stars α Lyræ,
α Ursæ Majoris, and γ Draconis have been the brightest stars
nearest the North Pole, and with such declinations that α Lyræ
would be visible at one of the dates, α Ursæ Majoris at another,
and γ Draconis at another still&mdash;all rising in nearly the same
amplitude far to the north.</p>

<p>In Chapter XVIII. I have shown that one of the temples, and
possibly a series of them, at Thebes were directed to γ Draconis.
It is interesting, then, to carry the inquiry further. It may
possibly explain how it is that we get a definite statement
about the <i>āk</i> of the Great Bear in one case and a certain sure
orientation to γ Draconis in the other.</p>

<p>In the first place, it has to be borne in mind that when a
star is circumpolar&mdash;that is, never sets&mdash;no temple can be
directed to its rising. Now, accepting the <i>āk</i> as the brightest
star (and as I stated in Chapter XVII., it might, indeed, have been
the central one as well in the old constellation, for we do not
know its limits), we have to deal with the facts concerning
α Ursæ Majoris, called by the Arabians Dubhe.</p>

<p>The latitude of Denderah is a little over 20° N., therefore
all stars with a less polar distance than that&mdash;or, to put it
another way, all stars with a declination greater than (90°-26° =
64°. N.)&mdash;will be circumpolar. Now, the declination of Dubhe
was greater than 64° between 4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 1500 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> (I neglect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204"> 204</span>
refractions and hills); hence, if there is any truth in the
statements made in the building ceremonials, the temple could
not have been founded between those dates.</p>

<p>But what are the records concerning this temple? We
know that the structure as we see it was built in the time
of the last Ptolemies and the first Roman emperors, and I have
already shown that at those dates the Great Bear (the old
Thigh) did not rise at all, as it was circumpolar.</p>

<p>It is also known that there was a temple here in
the time of Thothmes III., and even earlier, going back to
the earliest times of Egyptian history. King Pepi, of the
Sixth Dynasty (<i>circ.</i> 3233 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), is portrayed over and over
again in the crypts.</p>

<p>Even this is not all the evidence in favour of a high
antiquity. In one of the crypts (No. 9), according to Ebers
and Dümichen, there are two references to the earliest
plans of the temple. One inscription states that the great
ground-plan (<i>Senti</i>) of Ant (Denderah) was found in old
writing on parchments of the time of the followers of Horus
(sun-worshippers) preserved in the walls of the temple during
the reign of King Pepi. Another inscription goes further,
referring to the restoration by Thothmes III. (<i>circ.</i> 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) of
the temple to the state in which it was found described in old
writings of the time of the King Chufu (Cheops) of the Fourth
Dynasty (<i>circ.</i> 3733 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). If any faith is to be placed in this
inscription, it seems to me to suggest a still higher antiquity.
There would have been more reason for describing an antique
shrine than a brand new one.</p>

<p>Still another inscription runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"King Tehuti-mes III. has caused this building to be erected in memory of
his mother, the goddess Hathor, the Lady of An (Denderah), the eye of the
Sun, the heavenly queen of the gods. The ground plan was found in the city of
An, in archaic drawing on a leather roll of the time of the Hor-Shesu: it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205"> 205</span>
found in the interior of a brick wall in the south side of the temple in the reign
of King Pepi."<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But let us see what the facts are regarding the date
supplied by the temple itself, accepting the statement made
regarding the actual operations at the laying of the foundation
stone originally.</p>

<p>To determine the dates approximately, we find that an
amplitude of 71½° N. of E. in the latitude of Denderah gives a
declination of 57¾° N., with a sea horizon (correcting for refraction)
58¾° N. with hills 1° high, and 59¾° N. with hills 2° high,
which is not far from the exact conditions.</p>

<p>The star Dubhe had the declination of 60° N. in 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>If, then, I am right in my suggestion as to the word <i>āk</i>
referring to α Ursæ Majoris, we find the closest agreement
between the astronomical orientation; the definite statement
as to a certain star being used in the building ceremonies;
the inscriptions in the crypts referring to Cheops as the earliest
historical personage who describes the building, and to the
Shesu-Hor as the original designers of the building. According
to most authorities, 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> lands us in the times of the
Shesu-Hor before Mena.</p>

<p>I must confess that this justification of the double record
strikes me as very remarkable, and I think it will be
generally conceded that further local observations should be
made in order to attempt to carry the matter a stage beyond
a first approximation.</p>

<p>We have got so far, then. If we take the history as we find
it, and further take the trouble to work out the very definite
statements made, we find that the temple was founded pointing
to the rising of Dubhe before it became circumpolar, and that in
those times this star was symbolised by the name of Hathor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206"> 206</span></p>

<p>We may accept, then, the possibility that as the temple of
Isis was oriented to Sirius, that dedicated to Hathor was directed
to Dubhe.</p>

<p>It will have been obvious from what has preceded, that if
the worship of Hathor was to go on at all, and if it were in any
way connected with the observations of a star rising near the
north point of the horizon, a new star must be chosen when
α Ursæ Majoris became circumpolar. That is the first point.</p>

<p>I have already stated that α Ursæ Majoris began to be
circumpolar at Denderah 4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> I may now add that
γ Draconis ceased to be circumpolar about 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> They had
the same declination (62° N.) and the same amplitude (78° N.)
4400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Mariette's plan shows a second temple oriented to N. 6° E.,
which we may perhaps be justified in taking as N. 9° E., since
his azimuth of the great temple differs from Biot's and my
own by 3°.</p>

<p>The corresponding declination would be 68° N. of E.,
the declination of Dubhe in 4200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and of γ Draconis in
4300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The temple may well, therefore, have been erected
when both stars had the same amplitude, the apparent
difference of 100 years being due to the uncertainty of
the measures available.</p>

<p>The second point, then, is that when Dubhe, which, while
it rose and set, was the brightest star near the pole which did
so, <i>became circumpolar</i>; γ Draconis, when it <i>ceased to be
circumpolar</i>, fulfilled these conditions; astronomically, then, it
became the natural successor of α Ursæ Majoris.</p>

<p>I have before pointed out that it is not impossible that a
temple once oriented to a certain star, and long out of use on
account of the precessional movement, may be utilised for
another, and be rehabilitated in consequence, when that same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207"> 207</span>
movement brings another conspicuous star into the proper
rising amplitude.</p>

<p>This consideration at once leads to my third point, which
is, that after Dubhe became circumpolar the temple of Hathor
at Denderah would become useless&mdash;there would be no star
to watch&mdash;unless a new star was chosen.</p>

<p>Now, let us suppose this to have been so, and that the
natural successor of the star in question were chosen. Studying
the facts as before approximately, as final data are not yet
available, we have the declination 59¾° N. This was the
declination of γ Draconis about 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, assuming hills 2°
high, which I think is too much; 3300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, with hills 1½° high.</p>

<p>In the present case the orientation fits γ Draconis in the
historic period, but it also fits Dubhe in the times of the Hor-shesu,
the dimly-seen followers of Horus, or sun-worshippers,
before the dawn of the historic period.</p>

<p>Next let us go back to the inscriptions. We found that
King Pepi is portrayed over and over again in the crypts,
and, which is more important, that the plan of the temple on
parchment, dating from the times of the Shesu-Hor, had
actually been walled up in the temple during the reign of the
same king, no doubt at the ceremony of restoration or laying
a new foundation stone, as is sometimes done to this day.</p>

<p>Now, Pepi's date, according to the chronologists, is 3200
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, a difference of 100 years only from the rough orientation
date.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, the full importance of the work done in
Pepi's reign. The <i>āk</i> of the Thigh was no longer of use;
but a new star was now available. Hathor was rehabilitated.
Perhaps even the priests alone knew that the star had been
changed.</p>

<p>By the temple of Hathor, then, if we assume that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208"> 208</span>
record is absolutely true (and I, for one, believe in these old
records more and more), and that Cheops only described a
shrine founded by the Hor-shesu, we are carried back to
<i>circ.</i> 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> I am indebted to my friend Dr. Wallis Budge
for the suggestion that the position of Denderah as the
terminus of the highway from the Red Sea&mdash;which may soon
again be reached by a railway from Keneh to Kosseir!&mdash;would
have made it one of the most important places in
ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>It is important to note that at a very early date the traffic
between the Nile Valley and the Red Sea, and thence probably
with Arabia and South Africa, flourished, and grew to be a
by no means insignificant commerce.</p>

<p>According to Ebers,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> "the oldest and most famous of all
these highways is that which led from Koptos (Keneh, Denderah)
to the Red Sea, through the valley now known as the
Wady Hammamāt, and called by the ancient Egyptians
Rohanu. It was a busy high-road, not alone for trading
caravans, but from time to time for stonemasons and soldiers,
whose task it was to hew the costly building materials from
the hard rocks, which here abound, and to prepare the vast
monoliths which were finished <i>in situ</i>, and then to convey
them all to the residence of the Pharaohs. A remarkably
beautiful kind of alabaster, of a fine honey yellow or white as
snow, is found in these mountains." Another road led from
Esneh or Edfû to the ancient port of Berenice. We shall
see in the sequel that the temple of Redisieh on this route was
dedicated to the same cult as that at Denderah.</p>

<p>If the above results be confirmed, we have a most definite
indication of the fact that in the rebuilding in the times of
Pepi, Thothmes III., and the Ptolemies, the original orientation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209"> 209</span>
of the building was not disturbed; and that in the account
of the building ceremonies we are dealing as surely with the
laying of the first foundation-stone as with the original plan.</p>

<p>In any case the consideration has to be borne in mind that
the series of temples with high northern (and southern) amplitudes
at Denderah, Thebes, and possibly other places, were
nearly certainly founded before the time at which the heliacal
rising of Sirius, near the time of the summer solstice, was the
chief event of the year, watched by priests, astronomers&mdash;if the
astronomers were not the only priests&mdash;and agriculturists
alike. Now we know, from Biot's calculations, that this became
possible <i>circ.</i> 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and that Sirius&mdash;though, as
I am informed by Prof. Maspero, <i>not</i> its heliacal rising&mdash;is referred
to in inscriptions in pyramid times.</p>

<p>Subsequent research may possibly show that these temples
had to do with the heralding of sunrise throughout the year,
the Sirian temples being limited to New Year's Day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>STAR-CULTS.</small></h2></div>


<p>The last two chapters, then, have brought us so far. There are
two principal temples at Denderah. The smaller is called the
temple of Isis. It is oriented 18½° S. of E. The inscriptions
tell us that the light of Sirius shone into it, and that
Sirius was personified as Isis. We can determine astronomically
that the statement is true for the time about 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, which
was the date determined independently by Biot for the circular
zodiac referred to on page 18.</p>

<p>The larger temple is called the temple of Hathor. It is
oriented 71½° N. of E. The inscriptions very definitely
tell us what star cast its light along its axis, and give also
definite statements about the date of its foundation, which
enable us to determine astronomically that in all probability
the temple was oriented to Dubhe somewhat later than 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Now we are <i>certain</i> that Isis personified Sirius. That "Her
Majesty of Denderah" was Sirius, at all events in the later
times referred to in the inscriptions, is not only to be gathered
from the inscriptions, but has been determined astronomically.</p>

<p>It is also <i>probable</i> that Hathor personified Dubhe. Now
this looks very satisfactory, and it seems only necessary to test
the theory by finding temples of Isis and Hathor in other
places, and seeing whether or not they were oriented to Sirius
and Dubhe respectively.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for us, we have already learned from
Plutarch that Isis and Hathor are the same goddesses, although
they certainly personify different stars, if they personify stars
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211"> 211</span></p>

<p>We seem, then, in a difficulty, and at first sight matters do
not appear to be made any clearer by the fact that Hathor
(and, therefore, Isis) was worshipped under different names in
every nome.</p>

<p>Lanzoni, in his admirable volumes on Egyptian mythology,
gives us, not dealing with the matter from this point of view at
all, <i>no less than twenty-four variants for Hathor</i>!</p>

<p>In the temple at Edfû no less than 300 names are given
with the various local relations and forms used in the most
celebrated shrines.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In the inscriptions at Denderah itself a great number of
variants is given.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It is important to give some of them in
this place; the full value of the information thus afforded will
be seen afterwards.</p>

<p>One variant is of especial importance in the present connection,
and is emphasised in a special inscription in one of the
chambers of the temple of Hathor&mdash;<i>not</i>, be it remarked, in the
temple of Isis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Elle est la Sothis de Denderah, qui remplit le ciel et la terre de ses bienfaits.
Elle est la régente et la reine des villes.... Au Sud elle est la reine du<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212"> 212</span>
maître divin; au nord elle est la reine des divins ancêtres. Rien n'est établi
sans elle.... Elle est la grande dans le ciel, la reine parmi les étoiles."<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Well may Mariette remark on this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Cette invocation à Sothis, dans une chambre consacrée à la consécration de
certains produits de la terre, n'a rien qui doit surprendre. Sothis est le symbole
du renouvellement de l'année et de la résurrection de la nature. Au lever
héliaque de Sothis, le Nil sort de son lit. Jusqu'à ce moment la terre de
l'Égypte est stérile et nue. Fécondée par la fleuve, elle va se couvrir d'une verdure
nouvelle."</p>
</div>

<p>But the Sothis here in question is <i>Sirius</i>, the star to the
rising of which the temple of Isis, and <i>not</i> the temple of Hathor,
was directed!</p>

<p>We have, then, at Denderah a temple <i>not</i> pointed to Sirius,
the worship in which is that of Hathor, and there can be little
doubt that we have astronomically determined the fact that
"Her Majesty of Denderah" was really the star Sirius.</p>

<p>We can pass from Denderah to the temple of Hathor at
Thebes. The general plan of Thebes prepared by Lepsius
indicates the orientation of the temple of Dêr el-Bahari, to
which I refer, the temple in the western hills of Thebes,
embellished by Queen Hatshepset (<i>circ.</i> 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). This
temple, instead of being-oriented 71½° N. of E., lies 24½° S. of
E.; it can never, therefore, have faced the star observed in
the temple of Hathor at Denderah. There is also another
temple annexed to the temple of Amen-Rā, which received
the light of Sirius in former years. These temples were, in
all probability, intended to observe the same star which was
subsequently observed in the temple of Isis at Denderah.</p>

<p>That is one point; here is another. We have it from
Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> that Isis = Mut = Hathor = Methuer.</p>

<p>The amplitude of the temple at Denderah dedicated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213"> 213</span>
<i>Hathor</i> is 71½° N. of E. (59° N. declination). That of the
temple dedicated to Mut at Karnak is 72½° N. of E. (58¾° N.
declination), which, assuming for a moment the same star to
have been used, corresponds to a date (according to the
height of the horizon) of <i>circ.</i> 3000 to 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This is
therefore later than the original foundation of the Hathor
temple of Denderah, but not far from the date of its restoration
by Pepi.</p>

<p>It is fundamental to the orientation theory that the cult
shall follow the star. But we have here the same cult,
according to Plutarch; we are hence permitted to suggest
that in dealing with the temples of Hathor at Denderah and
Mut at Thebes we are dealing with local names of the same
goddess personifying the same star.</p>

<p>Two lines of argument may be followed to strengthen
this conclusion.</p>

<p>The first has to do with the orientation of the temple
of Mut at Thebes. There is no statement of its great
antiquity, as in the case of the temple of Hathor at Denderah.
Here we find again one of the great difficulties in our way,
the impossibility of running back to the original foundation
among the many restorations effected of the most important
among the Egyptian temples. The temple of Mut is ascribed
to Amen-hetep III., but I cannot hold this to be the original
foundation, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. With its orientation in the time of Amen-hetep III. it
pointed to no star in particular.</p>

<p>2. There is a series of four temples at Thebes turned to
the same part of the horizon nearly, their amplitudes ranging
from 62° to 72½° N. of E. Of these temples that of Mut
has the highest amplitude; the one with the lowest but one
is the temple lettered M by Lepsius. There is no question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214"> 214</span>
about the real founder of this temple, and there is not much
question as to the date of the founder, Rameses III.</p>

<p>Now in the time of this king a temple erected with the
orientation given pointed precisely to γ Draconis. (<i>See</i>
Chapter XVIII.) The amplitude was 62° N. of E.; the time,
1200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If we take the simplest case in the orientation
theory&mdash;that the amplitudes</p>

<p>were given to the various temples to enable observations
to be made of the same star, which was being carried nearer
the equator by the precessional movement, we can not only
date the temple of Mut, but find an explanation of Plutarch's
equation Hathor = Mut.</p>

<p>In other words, we watch the Mut-Hathor worship
provided for from 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to the times of the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>So that here we have a very concrete case of the cult
following the star, not only in the same place, but at different
places, and we are driven to the conclusion that Hathor at
Denderah and Mut at Thebes, exoterically different goddesses,
were esoterically the same star, γ Draconis.</p>

<p>We are not, however, limited to a comparison between
Denderah and Thebes. We have Annu and Abydos, and other
places, to appeal to, since there are temples remaining there
also facing N.E. Those at Abydos, however, we must leave
out of consideration here, as their exact orientation is not
determined. With regard to Heliopolis, and dealing with the
obelisk which tradition tells us was erected by Usertsen I.,
the orientation of its N.E. face, according to my own observations,
taking the present variation at 4½° W., is 77° N. of E.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215"> 215</span>
This corresponds approximately to a declination of 57½° N.,
which was the declination of γ Draconis in 2500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The
date given to Usertsen I. by Brugsch is 2433 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>This is very satisfactory so far, but we can go further.
Here we are landed evidently in the worship of one of the local
divine dynasties, that of Set; and we may justly, therefore,
ask if Usertsen did not do at Heliopolis what it is very
probable Pepi did at Denderah&mdash;namely, embellish an old
temple which had in the first instance been used for observations
of Dubhe and appropriate it to the use of the new
Hathor γ Draconis. If this were so, then the original
foundation stone was laid about 5100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The next line of argument is furnished by the emblems
which are associated with the various goddesses. These obviously
indicate that they arose in a time of totemism, when each tribe
or nome had its special totem, which would be certain to be
associated with the local goddesses or the stars which they
personified.</p>

<p>The local totem of the special warning-star in use at any
time or place may be anything: hippopotamus, crocodile, hawk,
vulture, lion, or even some other common living thing into which
the totem degraded when the supply of the original fell short.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Hence, as the number of warning-stars was certainly
very restricted, they&mdash;or, rather, the goddesses which typified
them&mdash;had different names in almost every nome. Hence
Egyptian mythology should be, as it is in fact, full of
synonyms; each local name being liable to be brought into
prominence at some time or another, owing to adventitious
circumstances relating either to dynasties or the popularity of
some particular shrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216"> 216</span></p>

<p>Applying this test of symbolism, we find in the case of
Hathor that the symbolism was double.</p>

<p>The Denderah <i>Hathor</i> was connected with the hippopotamus,
while at Thebes <i>Mut</i> was represented by a hippopotamus.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp35" id="i_p216" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p216.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"> CAPITAL, WITH MASKS OF HATHOR
WITH COWS' EARS.</div>
</div>

<p>Now this symbol of the hippopotamus
helps us greatly, because it
allows evidence to be gathered from
a consideration of the old constellations.
I do not think it is saying too
much to remark that among these
the attention of the North Egyptians
was almost exclusively confined to
the circumpolar ones. Further, the
mean latitude being, say, 25°, the
circumpolar region was a restricted
one; 50° in diameter, instead of over
100°, as with us. But not quite
exclusively, for to them in later
times, as to us now, the Great Bear
and <i>Orion</i> were the two most prominent
constellations in the heavens;
for them, as for us, they typified the
northern and southern regions of
the sky.</p>

<p>There can be no question that the chief ancient constellation
in the north was the Great Bear, or, as it was then pictured,
the Thigh (Mesχet). After this came the Hippopotamus.
I had come to the conclusion that this had been replaced on
our maps by part of Draco before I found that Brugsch and
Parthey had expressed the same opinion.</p>

<p>The female hippopotamus typified Taurt, the wife of Set
(represented by a jackal with erected tail, or hippopotamus),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217"> 217</span>
and one of the most ordinary forms of Hathor is a hippopotamus.
There is evidence that the star we are considering, γ Draconis,
occupied the place of the head or the mythical head-gear.</p>

<p>Here, then, in the actual symbolism of Hathor we find
γ Draconis as distinctly pointed to as by the orientation of
the temples.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_p217" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p217.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE COW OF ISIS.</div>
</div>

<p>The other symbolism is quite different; instead of a hippopotamus
we deal with a cow.</p>

<p>In the inscriptions at Denderah we find the star Sirius represented
by a cow in a boat. In the circular zodiac we have
the cow in the boat, the point of the beginning of the year, and
the constellation Orion, so located as to indicate clearly that, at
that time, the beginning of the year fell between the heliacal
rising of Sirius and of the stars in Orion. Sirius was Isis-Sothis.</p>

<p>If we go to Thebes, we pass there from the cow Isis-Sothis
to Isis-Hathor, and there we find the mythology retains the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218"> 218</span>
idea of the cow, the cow gradually appearing from behind the
western hills. There is not a doubt, I think, that the basis of
this mythological representation was, that the temple which
was built to observe the rising of the star at a time perhaps
somewhat later than that given by Biot (3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was situated
in the western hills of Thebes, so that Hathor, the goddess on
which the light was to fall in the sanctuary, was imaged as
dwelling in the western hills. At Philæ we get no longer
either Isis-Sothis or Isis-Hathor, but Isis-Sati.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_p218" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <div class="caption">HATHOR AS A COW.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219"> 219</span></p>

<p>Now just as certainly as the hippopotamus had to do with
the constellation Draco, the cow had to do with Sirius, for
Sirius was represented as a cow in a boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp84" id="i_p219" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p219.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HATHOR, "THE COW OF THE WESTERN HILLS."</div>
</div>

<p>It may be gathered from this how truly astronomical in
basis was the mythologic symbolism to which we have been
driven in the effort to obtain more light; and, indeed, it is
necessary for us to consider it still more closely.</p>

<small>STAR-CULTS (CONTINUED)&mdash;AMEN-T AND KHONS.</small></h2></div>


<p>When I had the privilege of discussing at Thebes the orientation
hypothesis with M. Bouriant, the distinguished head of
the French School of Archæology in Egypt, he suggested that
I should accompany him one day to Medînet-Habû, at which
place he was then superintending excavations, and where there
are three temples dedicated to Amen.</p>

<p>M. Bouriant, from the first, saw that if there were anything
in the new views, the cult must follow the star; and it was
natural, therefore, that the three temples dedicated to the
same divinity at the same place should be directed to the same
star. The three temples to which I refer are the two well-known
temples the lack of parallelism of which has been so
often remarked, and a third much smaller one, built more
recently, lying to the south-west. The amplitudes I found to
be as follows:&mdash;</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdc">Amplitude S. of E.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Ethiopian or Ptolemaic Temple</td>
<td class="tdc">45°</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdl">Great Temple</td>
<td class="tdc">46½°</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Ancient Temple</td>
<td class="tdc">51½°</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>On the orientation hypothesis we were dealing with a star
the S.E. amplitude of which was decreasing like that of Sirius;
<i>it was therefore in the same quarter of the heavens</i>.</p>

<p>But which star? To investigate this it was best to deal
in the first instance with the orientation of the great temple,
since its building date was supposed to be that most accurately
known; and there is not much danger in doing this in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221"> 221</span>
present case, because the king obviously had not expanded
an old temple, for there it still is alongside.</p>

<p>The king was Rameses III., the date, according to Brugsch,
1200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the hills to which the temples are directed may
be taken as 1° high. With these data we get the declination
appropriate to the amplitude of the temple 40° S. Now, this
was nearly the declination of the star Phact or α Columbæ in
the time of Rameses III.; the orientation date is 1250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Taking this star, then, and correcting for heights of hills
and refraction, we get approximately the following dates:&mdash;</p>

<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc"><span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></td>

<tr>
<td class="tdl"><span class="gap4r">Modern Temple</span></td>
<td class="tdr">900</td>

<td class="tdl">Great Temple</td>
<td class="tdr">1250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Ancient Temple</td>
<td class="tdr">2525</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>If the hills are taken as 1½° high, these dates will stand
750, 1150, and 2400.</p>

<p>The date 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we have already found as the probable
date of the undertaking of the restoration at Denderah. It is
the time of the victorious march of the Theban priests northwards
from their exile at Gebel Barkal.</p>

<p>The date 2400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> lands us in the times of the great
solstitial king, Usertsen I., about whom more in a subsequent
chapter. Although the more ancient temple is generally
ascribed to Thothmes III., traces of the work of Amen-hetep I.
have been discovered. I think we have a case here where the
eighteenth dynasty enlarged and embellished a shrine erected
by the twelfth dynasty, precisely as the temple of Amen-Rā
at Karnak has been traced back to the twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p>If I am right, then, it follows that temples erected to stars
associated in any way with the chief cult, such as that of
Amen-Rā, may either be dedicated to the god or goddess
personified by the star or to the associated solar deity. Thus at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222"> 222</span>
Thebes we have the temple of Mut, so-called, though Mut was
the wife of Amen-Rā; and the temples now under consideration,
called temples of Amen, though they are dedicated to the goddess
Amen-t, the wife of Amen. This may or may not be connected
with the fact that the first of them was dedicated possibly
before the cult of Amen alone had been intensified and
expanded by the Theban priests&mdash;probably in the eighteenth
dynasty&mdash;into the cult of the solstitial sun-god Amen-Rā.</p>

<p>There is evidence, indeed, that Amen-t replaced Mut in
the Theban triad. With regard to these triads, a few words
may be said here from the astronomical point of view, though
the subject, I am told, is one on which a great diversity of
opinion exists on the part of Egyptologists.</p>

<p>I have collected all the most definite statements I can find
on this head, and it is certainly interesting to see that in many
cases, though not in all, the triad seems to consist of a form of
the sun-god, together with two stellar divinities, one of them
certainly associated with the heliacal rising of the sun at some
time of the year, and therefore a recognised form of Isis or
Hathor. Thus we have:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223"> 223</span></p>

<p>Not only may this table enable us to see how Amen-t was
sunk at Medînet-Habû in the term Amen, but it enables us to
consider a similar case presented by those temples at Thebes,
some of them associated with Khons and another with Amen,
referred to in Chapter XVII.</p>

<p>The temple of <i>Khons</i> is among the best known at Karnak;
the visitor passes it before the great temple of Amen-Rā is
reached. M. Bouriant was able to prove, while we were
together at Karnak, that the temple of Seti II., nearly parallel
to it, was also dedicated to <i>Khons</i>; but the temple <span class="allsmcap">B</span> of Lepsius,
nearly parallel to both, is sacred to <i>Amen</i>. It is seen at once
that the main cult is the same, although the amount of detail
shown in the reference is different&mdash;we have the generic name
of the triad in one case, the specific name of the member of the
triad in the other.</p>

<p>As this is the first time a setting star has been in question,
it is well to point out that in this case the ancient Egyptians
no longer typified the star as a goddess but as a god&mdash;and, more
than this, as a dying god; for Khons is always represented as
a <i>mummy</i>&mdash;the Osiris form. Egyptologists state that both
Thoth and Khons were moon-gods. Perhaps the lunar attributes
were assigned prior to the establishment of sun-worship.</p>

<p>I shall show, subsequently, that the temples now being
considered find their place in continuous series stretching back
in the case of Amen-t to 3750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and in the case of Khons to
possibly a long anterior date.</p>

<p>In the case of Amen-t and Khons, therefore, where we are
free from the difficulties connected with the interchange of the
titles of Isis and Hathor at Denderah, the star-cults stand
out much more clearly, and we get a step further into the
domain of mythology.</p>

<p>But what did the cults mean? What was the utility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224"> 224</span>
them? What their probable origin? The cult of Sirius we
already understand.</p>

<p>I will deal with Amen-t first. No doubt it will have been
already asked how it came that such an unfamiliar star as
Phact had been selected.</p>

<p>Here the answer is overwhelming. This star, although so
little familiar to us northerners, is one of the most conspicuous
of the stars in the southern portion of the heavens, <i>and its
heliacal rising heralded the solstice and the rise of the Nile before the
heliacal rising of Sirius was useful for that purpose</i>!</p>

<p>In Phact we have the star symbolised by the ancient
Egyptians under the name of the goddess Amen-t or Teχi,
whose figure in the month table at the Ramesseum leads the
procession of the months.</p>

<p>Amen-t, the wife of the solstitial sun-god Rā, symbolised
the star the rising of which heralded the solstice; and the
complex title Amen-Rā signified in ancient times, to <i>those who
knew</i>, that the solstitial sun-god Rā, so heralded, was meant.</p>

<p>The answer is clear, though not so simple in the case of
Khons. The setting of Canopus marked the autumnal equinox
about 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> We have found that the first Khons temple at
Karnak was possibly built as late as 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the utility
of the observations of Canopus from this point of view had
therefore ceased; but it is also known that Khons was a late
addition to the Theban triad, and I shall subsequently give
evidence that the worship was introduced from the south,
where it had been conducted when the condition of utility held.
The time of introduction to Thebes was the beginning of the
eighteenth dynasty, when the priests wished to increase their
power by conciliating all worships; and we now see that with
their local sun-god Amen-Rā and the goddess Amen-t, with the
Northern Mut (Isis) and the Southern Khons, the Theban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225"> 225</span>
triad represented the worship of Central, Northern and
Southern Egypt.</p>

<p>It is an important fact to bear in mind that in the North of
Egypt in early times the stellar temples were more particularly
directed to the north, while south of Thebes, so far as I know,
there is only one temple so directed. It is suggested, therefore,
that the Theban priests amalgamated the northern and
southern cults, probably for political purposes. There is evidence
that the priests were at heart more sympathetic with the
southern cults, and a further investigation of this matter may
eventually help us in several points of Egyptian history.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed also that so far as we have gone,
whether discussing solar or stellar temples, we have had to
associate the cults carried on in most of them with some
particular season of the year. If I am right, in the worships at
Denderah, Medînet-Habû, and Karnak, we have a strict reference
to the year, and in Egypt the year was always, as it is
now, associated with the rise of the river.</p>

<p>The sacred river must now occupy our attention for
a while; we must become familiar with its phenomena, and
the divisions of time and the calendar systems which were
associated with them.</p>

<small>THE EGYPTIAN YEAR AND THE NILE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Our researches so far leave no doubt upon the question that a
large part of the astronomical activity of the earliest Egyptians
had reference to observations connected especially with New
Year's Day. It has been made abundantly clear, too, that in
very early times the Egyptians had a solar year commencing
at the Summer Solstice, and that this solstice was then, and
is now, coincident with the arrival of the Nile flood at
Heliopolis and Memphis, the most important centres of
northern Egyptian life during the early dynasties.</p>

<p>In the dawn of civilisation it was not at all a matter of
course that the sun should be taken as the measurer of time,
as it is now with us; and in this connection it is worth while
to note how very diverse the treatment of this subject was
among the early peoples. Thus, for instance, it was different
in Egypt from what it was in Chaldæa and Babylonia, and
later among the Jews. In the Egyptian inscriptions we find
references to the moon, but they prove that she occupied quite
a subordinate position to the sun, at least in the later times.
The week of seven days was utterly unknown amongst the
Egyptians. Everything that can be brought forward in its
favour belongs to the latest periods. The passage quoted
by Lepsius from the Book of the Dead proves nothing, since,
according to Krall, an error has crept into his translation. In
Babylonia it would seem that the moon was worshipped as well
as the sun; and it was thus naturally used for measuring time;
and, so far as months were concerned, this, of course, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227"> 227</span>
quite right. In Babylonia, too, where much desert travel had
to be undertaken at night, the movements of the moon would
be naturally watched with great care.</p>

<p>An interesting point connected with this is that, among
these ancient peoples, the celestial bodies which gave them
the unit period of time by which they reckoned were practically
looked upon in the same category. Thus, for instance,
in Egypt the sun being used, the unit of time was a year;
but in Babylonia the unit of time was a month, for the reason
that the standard of time was the moon. Hence, when periods
of time were in question, it was quite easy for one nation to
conceive that the period of time used in another was a year
when really it was a month, and <i>vice versâ</i>. It has been suggested
that the years of Methuselah and other persons who
are stated to have lived a considerable number of years were
not solar years but lunar years&mdash;that is, properly, lunar
months This is reasonable, since, if we divide the numbers
by twelve, we find that they come out very much the same
length as lives are in the present day, and there is no reason
why this should not be so.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that the country in which the
sun was definitely accepted as the most accurate measurer of
time was Egypt.</p>

<p>Rā, the sun, was the chief god of ancient Egypt. He was
worshipped throughout the various nomes. Even the oldest
texts (<i>cf.</i> that of Menkaurā in the British Museum) tell of
the brilliant course of Rā across the celestial vault and his
daily struggle with darkness.</p>

<p>"The Egyptians," says Ranke in the first chapter of his
"Universal History," which is devoted to Egypt, "have
determined the motion of the sun as seen on earth, and
according to this the year was divided, in comparison with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228"> 228</span>
Babylon, in a scientific and practically useful way, so that
Julius Cæsar adopted the calendar from the Egyptians and
introduced it into the Roman Empire. The other nations
followed suit, and since then it has been in general use
for seventeen centuries. The calendar may be considered as
the noblest relic of the most ancient times which has influenced
the world."</p>

  <div class="caption">THE ANNUAL RISE AND FALL OF THE NILE. (<i>From Horner.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Wherever the ancient Egyptians came from—whether from
a region where the moon was the time-measurer or not—so
soon as they settled in the valley where the Nile then, as
now, like a pendulum slowly beat the years by its annual
inundation at the Summer Solstice, the solar basis of their
calendar was settled. Hence it was Nature, the Nile&mdash;on
the regulation of which depended the welfare of the country&mdash;which
facilitated the establishment of the Egyptian year.
Solstice and Nile-flood are the turning-points of the old
Egyptian year.</p>

<p>That Egypt is the gift of the Nile is a remark we owe
to the Father of History, who referred not only to the fertilising
influence of the stream, but to the fact that the
presence of the Nile, and its phenomena, are the conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229"> 229</span>
upon which the habitability of Egypt altogether depends.
That the Egyptian year and that part of Egyptian archæology
and myth which chiefly interests astronomers are also the gift
of the Nile, is equally true.</p>

<p>The heliacal rising of Sirius and other stars at the time
of the commencement of the inundation each year; all the
myths which grew out of the various symbols of the stars
so used; are so many evidences of the large share the river,
with its various water-levels at different times, had in the
national life. It was, in fact, the true and unique basis of
the national life.</p>

<p>In this the Nile had a compeer or even compeers. What
the Nile was to Egypt the Euphrates and Tigris were to a
large region of Western Asia, where also we find the annual
flood a source of fertility, a spectacle which inspired poets,
and an event with which astronomers largely occupied
themselves.</p>

  <div class="caption">HĀPI, THE GOD OF THE
NILE.</div>
</div>

<p>What more natural than that Euphrates,
Tigris, and Nile were looked upon as
deities; that the gods of the Nile valley
on the one hand, and of the region
watered by the Euphrates and Tigris,
on the other, were gods to swear by;
that they were worshipped in order that
their benign influences might be secured,
and that they had their local shrines and
special cults?</p>

<p>The god sacred to the Euphrates and
Tigris was called Ea.</p>

<p>The god sacred to the Nile was called
Hāpi. The name is the same as that of
the bull Apis, the worship of which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230"> 230</span>
attributed to Mena.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Certainly Mena, Mini, or Menes, as he
is variously called, was fully justified in founding the cult of
the river-god, for he first among men appears to have had just
ideas of irrigation, and I have heard the distinguished officers
who have lately been responsible for the irrigation system of
to-day speaking with admiration of the ideas and works of
Mena. Whether the Tigris had a Mena in an equally early
time is a point on which history is silent; but, according
to the accounts of travellers, the Tigris in flood is even more
majestic than the Nile, and yet the latter river in flood is
a sight to see&mdash;a whole fertile plain turned, as it were, into
an arm of the sea, with here and there an island, which, on
inspection, turns out to be a village, the mud houses of
which too often are undermined by the lapping of the waves
in the strong north wind.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the dates of the rise of these
rivers not only influenced the national life, but even the
religions of the dwellers on their banks. The Euphrates
and Tigris rise at the Spring Equinox&mdash;the religion was
equinoxial, the temples were directed to the east. The Nile
rises at a solstice&mdash;the religion was solstitial and the solar
temples were directed no longer to the east. To the Egyptians
the coming of the river to the parched land was as the sunrise
chasing the darkness of the night; the sun-god of day conquering
the star-gods of night; or again the victorious king
of the land slaughtering his enemies.</p>

<p>Egypt, in the words of Amru, first appears like a dusty
plain, then as a fresh sea, and finally as a bed of flowers.</p>

<p>It might be imagined at first sight that as the year was
thus determined, so to speak, by natural local causes, the
divisions or seasons would be the same as those which Nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231"> 231</span>
has given <i>us</i>. This is not so. The river and land conditions
are so widely different.</p>

<p>By no one, perhaps, have the actual facts been so truly and
poetically described as by Osborn, who thus pictures the low
Nile<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Nile has shrunk within its banks until its stream is contracted to half
its ordinary dimensions, and its turbid, slimy, stagnant waters scarcely seem to
flow in any direction. Broad flats or steep banks of black, sun-baked Nile mud,
form both the shores of the river. All beyond them is sand and sterility; for
the hamseen, or sand-wind of fifty days' duration, has scarcely yet ceased to
blow. The trunks and branches of trees may be seen here and there through the
dusty, hazy, burning atmosphere, but so entirely are their leaves coated with
dust that at a distance they are not distinguishable from the desert sand that
surrounds them. It is only by the most painful and laborious operation of
watering that any tint approximating to greenness can be preserved at this
season even in the pleasure-gardens of the Pacha. The first symptom of the
termination of this most terrible season is the rising of the north wind (the
Etesian wind of the Greeks), blowing briskly, often fiercely, during the whole of
the day. The foliage of the groves that cover Lower Egypt is soon disencumbered
by it of the dust, and resumes its verdure. The fierce fervours of the sun,
then at its highest ascension, are also most seasonably mitigated by the same
powerful agency, which prevails for this and the three following months
throughout the entire land of Egypt."</p>
</div>

<p>Then comes the inundation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Perhaps there is not in Nature a more exhilarating sight, or one more
strongly exciting to confidence in God, than the rise of the Nile. Day by day
and night by night, its turbid tide sweeps onward majestically over the parched
sands of the waste, howling wilderness. Almost hourly, as we slowly ascended
it before the Etesian wind, we heard the thundering fall of some mud-bank, and
saw, by the rush of all animated Nature to the spot, that the Nile had overleapt
another obstruction, and that its bounding waters were diffusing life and joy
through another desert. There are few impressions I ever received upon the
remembrance of which I dwell with more pleasure than that of seeing the first
burst of the Nile into one of the great channels of its annual overflow. All
Nature shouts for joy. The men, the children, the buffaloes, gambol in its
refreshing waters, the broad waves sparkle with shoals of fish, and fowl of every
wing flutter over them in clouds. Nor is this jubilee of Nature confined to the
higher orders of creation. The moment the sand becomes moistened by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232"> 232</span>
approach of the fertilising waters, it is literally alive with insects innumerable.
It is impossible to stand by the side of one of these noble streams, to see it
every moment sweeping away some obstruction to its majestic course, and
widening as it flows, without feeling the heart to expand with love and joy and
confidence in the great Author of this annual miracle of mercy."</p>

<p>After the flood comes the sowing time. The effects
of the inundation, as Osborn shows in another place,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"exhibit themselves in a scene of fertility and beauty such as will scarcely be
found in another country at any season of the year. The vivid green of the
springing corn, the groves of pomegranate-trees ablaze with the rich scarlet of
their blossoms, the fresh breeze laden with the perfumes of gardens of roses and
orange thickets, every tree and every shrub covered with sweet-scented flowers.
These are a few of the natural beauties that welcome the stranger to the land of
Ham. There is considerable sameness in them, it is true, for he would observe
little variety in the trees and plants, whether he first entered Egypt by the
gardens of Alexandria or the plain of Assouan. Yet is it the same everywhere,
only because it would be impossible to make any addition to the sweetness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233"> 233</span>
of the odours, the brilliancy of the colours, or the exquisite beauty of the many
forms of vegetable life, in the midst of which he wanders. It is monotonous,
but it is the monotony of Paradise."</p>

<p>The flood reaches Cairo on a day closely approximating
to that of the Summer Solstice. It attains its greatest height,
and begins to decline near the Autumnal Equinox. By the
Winter Solstice the Nile has again subsided within its banks
and resumed its blue colour. Seed-time has occurred in this
interval.</p>

<p>The terms for the seasons and months are found even on
the building material of the largest pyramid of Dashûr, and
in the oldest records we already find calendar indications. On

<p>In order to show how the astronomy of the ancient
Egyptians&mdash;to deal specially with them&mdash;was to a large extent
concerned with the annual flood and all that depended upon
that flood; and how the first tropical year used on this planet, so
far as we know, was established, it is important to study the
actual facts of the rise somewhat closely, not only for Egypt
generally, but for several points in the line, some thousand
miles in extent, along which in the earliest times cities and
shrines were dotted here and there.</p>

<p>Time out of mind the fluctuations in the height of the river
have been carefully recorded at different points along the
river. In the "Description de l'Égypte" we find a full
description of the so-called nilometer at Aswân (First Cataract),
which dates from a remote period, perhaps as early as the fifth
dynasty.</p>

<p>In Ebers' delightful book on Egypt space is given to
the description of the much more modern one located at
Rôda.</p>

<p>The nilometer, or "mikyās," on the island of Rôda, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235"> 235</span>
visible, is stated to have replaced one which was brought thither
from Memphis at some unrecorded date. Makrīzī in 1417,
according to Ebers, saw the remains of
the older nilometer.</p>

<div class="figright illowp30" id="i_p235" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p235.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SCALE OF THE
NILOMETER AT RÔDA.</div>
</div>

<p>The present mikyās is within a covered
vault or chamber, the roof being supported
on simple wooden pillars. In a quadrangular
tank in communication with the
river by a canal is an octagon pillar on
which the Arabic measurements are inscribed.
These consist of the pic (variously
called ell or cubit) = 0·54 metre,
which is divided into twenty-four kirats.
In consequence of the rise of the river
bed in relatively recent times, the nilometer
is submerged at high Nile to a
depth of two cubits.</p>

<p>The rise of the Nile can now be carefully
studied, as gauges are distributed
along the river. We have the Aswân
gauge from 1869, the Armant gauge from
1887, the Suhag gauge from 1889, and
the Asyût gauge from 1892. The distances
of these gauges from Aswân are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Great vagueness arises in there being no very obvious distinction
between the gauge readings reached in summer and
that from which the rise is continuous. There are apparently
rainfalls in the end of spring of sufficient power to raise the
Nile visibly in summer, just as muddy rises have been seen in
winter to pass down the valley, leaving a muddy mark on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237"> 237</span>
rocks at Aswân and Manfalūt. Independently of the actual
gauge-reading of the rise, there are facts about it which strike
every beholder. At the commencement of the rise we have the
<i>green water</i>. This occurs in June, but varies in date as much as
the top of the flood varies.</p>

<p>From the fact that modern observations show that the very
beginning of the rise, and the first flush, second flush and final
retirement vary, it seems evident that the ancient Egyptians
could not have had any fixed zero-gauge or time for the real
physical fact of the rise, but must have deduced from a series
of observations either a mean period of commencement, or a
mean arrival of the red water, or a mean rising up to a certain
gauge.</p>

<p>First, to deal with the green water. Generally when the
rise of an inch or two is reported from the nilometer at Rôda,
the waters lose the little of clearness and freshness they still
possessed. The green colour is the slimy, lustreless hue of
brackish water within the tropics, and no filter that has yet
been discovered can render such water clear. The colour is
really due to algæ.</p>

<p>Happily, the continuance of this state of the water seldom
exceeds three or four days. The sufferings of those who are
compelled to drink it in this state, from vesical disease, even
in this short interval, are very severe. The inhabitants of the
cities generally provide against it by Nile water stored in
reservoirs and tanks.</p>

<p>Colonel Ross, R.E., noticed in 1887 and in 1890, when, owing
to the slow retreat of the Nile, the irrigation officers had to hold
back many basins in the Gîzeh province, and also in 1888
when the water remained long stagnant, that the basin water
got green&mdash;showed the algæ and smelt marshy&mdash;just as the
June green water does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238"> 238</span></p>

<p>Hence it has been argued that, as the Nile water in the bed
of the stream&mdash;even in very slow-flowing back-waters&mdash;does
not become green, the greenness must be produced by an almost
absolute stagnation of the water. We know of great marshes up
above Gondokoro, and hence it is thought that the green water
of summer, which comes on suddenly, is this marsh-water being
pushed out by the new water from behind, and that is why it
heralds the rise. No one has so far minutely observed the
gradual intrusion of the green water.</p>

<p>The rise of the river proceeds rapidly, and the water
gradually becomes more turbid. Ten or twelve days,
however, elapse before the development of the last and most
extraordinary of all the appearances of the Nile, thus described
by Mr. Osborn<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was at the end of&mdash;to my own sensations&mdash;a long and very sultry night,
that I raised myself from the sofa upon which I had in vain been endeavouring
to sleep, on the deck of a Nile boat that lay becalmed off Benisoueff, a town of
Middle Egypt. The sun was just showing the upper limb of his disc over the
eastern mountains. I was surprised to see that when his rays fell upon the
water a deep ruddy reflection was given back. The depth of the tint increased
continually as a larger portion of his light fell upon the water, and before he
had entirely cleared the top of the hill it presented the perfect appearance of a
river of blood. Suspecting some delusion, I rose up hastily, and, looking over
the side of the boat, saw there the confirmation of my first impression. The
entire body of the water was opaque and of a deep red colour, bearing a closer
resemblance to blood than to any other natural production to which it could be
compared. I now perceived that during the night the river had visibly risen
several inches. While I was gazing at this great sight the Arabs came round
me to explain that it was the Red Nile. The redness and opacity of the water,
in this extraordinary condition of the river, are subject to constant variations.
On some days, when the rise of the river has not exceeded an inch or two, its
waters return to a state of semi-transparency, though during the entire period
of the high Nile they never lose the deep red tinge which cannot be separated
from them. It is not, however, like the green admixture, at all deleterious; the
Nile water is never more wholesome or more deliciously refreshing than during
the overflow. There are other days when the rise of the river is much more
rapid, and then the quantity of mud that is suspended in the water exceeds, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239"> 239</span>
Upper Egypt, that which I have seen in any other river. On more than one
occasion I could perceive that it visibly interfered with the flow of the stream.
A glassful of it in this state was allowed to remain still for a short time. The
upper portion of it was perfectly opaque and the colour of blood. A sediment
of black mud occupied about one-quarter of the glass. A considerable portion of
this is deposited before the river reaches Middle and Lower Egypt. I never
observed the Nile water in this condition there, and indeed no consecutive observations
exist of the reddening of the water. It is quite clear that the reddening
cannot come from the White Nile, but must be the first floods of the Blue Nile
and Bahral Azral coming down."</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most important matters for the purposes of
our present inquiry is connected with the influence upon
local calendars, in different parts of the Nile valley, of the
variations of the phenomena upon which the Egyptians
depended for the marking of New Year's Day.</p>

<p>If the <i>solstice</i> had been taken alone, the date of it would
have been the same for all parts of the valley; but certainly
the solstice was not taken alone, and for the obvious reason,
that they wanted something to warn them of the Nile rise,
and in the lower reaches of the river the rise precedes the
solstice. Nor was the heliacal rising of Sirius, of which more
presently, taken alone.</p>

<p>But it was chiefly a question of the arrival of the Nile flood,
and the date of the commencement of the Nile flood was by
no means common to all parts of Egypt.</p>

<p>Now it is to be gathered from the modern gauges that it
takes the flood some time, as we can easily imagine, to pass
down the 600 miles between Elephantine and Cairo.</p>

<p>In the early flood, rising from, say, one cubit Aswân to six
cubits, where there are many dry sandbanks, and the spreading
out of the river is considerable, and there is an absence of
overlapping flushes from behind, the rate goes up to fifteen
days, and the <i>earliest</i> indication of the rise may take longer
still, but this is very difficult to observe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240"> 240</span></p>

<p>The rate in Hood is 1¾ days from Wādy Halfa to Aswân,
and six days from Aswân to Rôda (941 kilometres). In
very high Niles this is perhaps accelerated to five days.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, a very great difference in time and
rate between Green and Red Nile.</p>

<p>The rise is 45 ft. at Aswân, 38 at Thebes, and 25 at Cairo.</p>

<p>From the data obtained at the gauges named, which have
been kindly forwarded to me by Mr. Garstin, the Under
Secretary of State of the Public Works Department of Egypt,
I have ascertained that the average time taken by the first
indication of the flood to travel between Thebes and Memphis
is now about nine days.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that the river-bed is now
higher than formerly; the land around Thebes, according to
Budge, has been raised about nine feet in the last 1,700 years.</p>

<p>If, therefore, at each great city, such as Thebes and Heliopolis,
New Year's Day depended absolutely on the arrival of
the inundation, not only would the day have been uncertain,
but the difference of time in the arrival of the Hood at various
places along the river would represent a difference in the New
Year's Days of those places, compared to which our modern
differences of local time sink into insignificance, for they only
touch hours of the day.</p>

<p>The great difficulty experienced in understanding the
statements generally made concerning the Nile-rise is due
to the fact that the maximum flood is, as a rule, registered
in Cairo upwards of forty days after the maximum at Aswân.</p>

<p>For the following account of how this is brought about
I am indebted to the kindness of Colonel Ross, R.E.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The behaviour of the flood at the Aswân gauge is as follows: Between
August 20 and 30 a good average gauge of 16 cubits is often reached,
and between August 27 and September 3 there is often a drop of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241"> 241</span>
30 centimetres. The August rise is supposed to be mostly due to the Blue
Nile and Atbara River. Between September 1 and 8 the irrigation officers
generally look for a maximum flood-gauge of the year at Aswân. This is
supposed to be the first flush of the White Nile. In the middle of September
there are generally two small flushes, but the last twenty days of
September are generally distinctly lower than that of the first week. The
final flush of the Nile is seldom later than the 21st to 25th September.</p>

<p>"All this water does not merely go down the Nile; it floods the
different basins. The opening of these basins begins from the south to
the north. This operation is generally performed between the 29th September
and the 22nd October. The great Central Egypt basins are not connected
with the Nile for purposes of discharge into the river between Asyût and
near Wasta, or a distance of 395-90 kilometres = 305 kil.</p>

<p>"The country in the middle or Central Egypt is broad, and thus there
is an enormous quantity of water poured out of these basins into the
lower reaches of the river about the 20th October, which seriously raises
the Nile at Cairo, and in a good average year will bring the Cairo gauge
(at Rôda) up to the maximum of the year on or about October 22,
and hence it is that the guide-books say the Nile is at its highest in the
end of October.</p>

<p>"A gauge of 16½ cubits at Aswân while the basins are being filled
does not give more than 21 cubits at Rôda (Cairo), but, as the basins
with a 16½ gauge will fill by the 10th September, it follows that a 16½
to 16 cubit gauge at Aswân will not give a constant Cairo gauge, as
the great mass of water passes by the basins and reaches Cairo. Hence
we have frequently the paradox of a steady or falling gauge at Aswân
showing a steady rise at Cairo.</p>

<p>"If the gauge at Aswân keeps above 16 cubits to near the end of
September, the basin-emptying is much retarded, as the emptying at each
successive basin fills the Nile above the 16 cubit level; <i>hence the lower
halves of the basins do not flow off</i>, and thus, when the great Middle
Egypt basins are discharged, they do not raise the Nile so much as they
do when the last half of September Nile is below 16 at Aswân.</p>

<p>"In years like 1887 and 1892, which differ from each other only in
date of maximum gauge at Aswân, the river, having filled the basins in
fifteen to twenty days instead of in twenty-five to thirty days, comes down
to Cairo in so largely increased a volume that a really dangerous gauge
of 25 cubits at Cairo is maintained for over a fortnight (the average
October gauge in Cairo is about 23 cubits), and from September 10 to
October 25 the river remains from 24 cubits to 25½ cubits, and the Middle
Egypt basins discharge so slowly that the opening day is hardly traceable
on the Cairo gauge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242"> 242</span></p>

<p>"In the 1878 flood, which was the most disastrous flood possible, the
river rose in the most abnormal fashion, and on October 3 attained
18 cubits at Aswân. This breached the Delta, and in addition so delayed
the Upper Egypt basins emptying, from the reason before given, that the
wheat was sown too late, and got badly scorched by the hot winds of
March and April."<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<small>THE YEARS OF 360 AND 365 DAYS.</small></h2></div>


<p>Whether the Egyptians brought their year with them or
invented it in the Nile valley, there is a belief that it at
first consisted of 360 days only, that is, 5¼ days too little.</p>

<p>It is more likely that they brought the lunar month with them,
taking it roughly as 30 days (30 × 12 = 360), than that they
began with such an erroneous notion of the true length of the
solar year, seeing that in Egypt, above all countries in the
world, owing to the regularity of the inundation, the true
length could have been so easily determined, so soon as that
regularity was recognised. We must not in these questions
forget to put ourselves in the place of these pioneers of
astronomy and civilisation; if we do this, we shall soon see
how many difficulties were involved in determining the true
length of such a cycle as a year, when not only modern
appliances, but all just ideas too, were of necessity lacking.</p>

<p>Since 360 days do not represent the true length of the year,
it is clear that any nation which uses such a year as that will
find the seasons and festivals sweeping through the year.
Further, such a year is absolutely useless for the agriculturist,
or the gardener, because after a time the same month, to
say nothing of the same day of the month, will not mean
reaping-time, will not mean sowing-time, or anything else.</p>

<p>Still, it is right that I should state that all authorities are not
agreed as to the use of this year of 360 days; at all events,
during the times within our ken. Maspero<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> states:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244"> 244</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Des observations nouvelles, faites sur le cours du soleil, décidèrent les
astronomes à intercaler chaque année, après le douzième mois, et avant le
premier jour de l'année suivante, cinq jours complémentaires, qu'on nomma
<i>les cinq jours en sus de l'année</i> ou jours <i>epagomènes</i> (<i>epacts</i>). L'époque de
ce changement était si ancienne que nous ne saurions lui assigner aucune date,
et que les Egyptiens eux-mêmes l'avaient reportée jusque dans les temps
mythiques antérieurs à l'avènement de Mini."</p>
</div>

<p>Ideler<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> is of the same opinion as Maspero:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I do not hesitate ... to declare that the existence of such a time cycle&mdash;used
without reference to the course of the sun or moon simply for the sake
of simple figures&mdash;is extremely doubtful to me."</p>
</div>

<p>Krall remarks (p. 17):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is probable that the year of 360 days dates from the time before the
immigration into the Nile valley, when the Egyptians were unguided by the
regular recurrence of the Nile flood. In any case, this must soon have convinced
the priests that the 360-days year did not agree with the facts. But it is
well known to everybody familiar with these things how long a period may be
required before such determinations are practically realised, especially with a
people so conservative of ancient usages as the Egyptians."</p>
</div>

<p>And on this ground, apparently, he joins issue with the
authorities already quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Egyptian monuments have contradicted Ideler in this respect. The
trilingual inscription of Tanis testifies expressly that it has only 'later become
usual to add the five epagomenes;' that, therefore, the year originally had 360
days, which were divided into twelve months of thirty days each."</p>
</div>

<p>Krall also argues that the expressions great and little year
and their hieroglyphics referred to the rears of 365 and 360
days respectively, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If we inquire into the time at which the epagomenes were introduced, we
can only fix approximate dates. If the calendars of the Mastabas, complete as
they are, do not mention the epagomenes, whereas inscriptions of the period of
the Amenamhāts refer to them, this can only be due to the circumstance that the
epagomenes were only introduced in the meantime, but probably nearer the
upper than the lower limit.... For the sake of completeness, we may mention
that, according to Censorinus, the five epagomenes were introduced by the King
Arminon.... Louth conjectures that Arminon is identical with Amenamhāt I.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245"> 245</span>
under whom the epagomenes are first met with. But since, between Nitokris
and Amenamhāt I., there is a period of 500 years void of records, and the name
Arminon has nothing to do with Amenamhāt, we can hardly share this view."</p>
</div>

<p>However this knotty point may subsequently be settled by
Egyptologists, from the astronomers point of view the words
of Ideler<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;"Had ignorance lead to the establishment of a
year of 360 days, yet experience would have led to its rejection
in a few years"&mdash;will carry conviction with them. Indeed, one
may ask whether it is not possible that the use of the 360-day
year, and the complications which it involved, may have had
something to do with the foundation of the solar temples.</p>

<p>Let us attempt to put ourselves, in imagination, in the place
of the ancient Egyptians after the use of this 360-day year had
been continued for any length of time. It is perfectly certain
that now in this part of the Nile valley, now in that, everybody,
from Pharaoh to fellah, must have got his calendar into the
most hopeless confusion, compared with which "the year of
confusion" was mere child's-play, and that the exact determination
of the times, either of state functions or sowing,
reaping, or the like, by means of such a calendar would
have been next to impossible.</p>

<p>As each year dropped 5¼ days, it is evident that in about
seventy years (365·25∕5·25) a cycle was accomplished, in which New
Year's Day swept through all the months. The same month
(so far as its name was concerned) was now in the inundation
time, now in the sowing time, and so on. Of fixed agricultural
work for such months as these there could be none.</p>

<p>It must have been, then, that there were local attempts to
retain the coincidences between the true and the calendar year&mdash;intercalation
of days or even of months being introduced, now
in one place, now in another; and these attempts, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246"> 246</span>
would make confusion worse confounded, as the months might
vary with the district, and not with the time of year.</p>

<p>That this is what really happened is, no doubt, the origin of
the stringent oath required of the Pharaohs in after times, to
which I shall subsequently refer.</p>

<p>To acknowledge that the calendar year was wrong implied
that they knew the length of the true one. How had
they found it out? I think there can be no question that
this knowledge had come to them by observations either of
the solstices or the equinoxes. It is true they had the inundation;
but, as we have seen, the rise is not absolutely
regular, and the inundation takes many days to travel from
Philæ to Cairo (Memphis). If, then, the inundation had
fixed the beginning of the year, each nome would have its
special New Year's Day, and this would never have been
tolerated by a settled government embracing the whole
Nile valley, especially as each king's reign was supposed to
commence on New Year's Day.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the solstitial temples and the pyramids
were, if not actually requisite for settling the matter, at all
events all that was necessary, if they existed.</p>

<p>But now comes in a most interesting and important point.
If observations of the sun at solstice or equinox had been alone
made use of, the true length of the year would have been
determined in a few years. But the next scene in Egyptian
history shows us that the true length of the year was not
determined, but only an approximation to it.</p>

<p>How was this? The astronomical answer is very simple.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the common practice of all
ancient peoples that we know of to make sacrifices at dawn,
and have shown how, in order to do this, they took their time
from a star rising before the sun. An observation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247"> 247</span>
so-called "heliacal rising" of a star&mdash;if the star were properly
chosen&mdash;would give them the interval necessary for their preparations
before the sun itself appeared; and, as the highest
festival of all was that of New Year's Day, it was especially
important that the work should be well done then.</p>

<p>Now, if the stars had no precessional movement, the sun
and stars, after each interval of a true year, would be in exactly
the same position; but in consequence of the stars having the
precessional movement to which I have before referred, the
star so observed and the sun will <i>not</i> be in exactly the same
position after the interval of a true year. On this account,
then, the difference of time between the heliacal risings will
not represent the length of a true year. But, further, the
heliacal rising of the star will not take place on the same day
for the whole of Egypt, the difference between Thebes and
Memphis, depending upon their latitudes, amounting to about
four days; and, further still, the almost constant mists in the
mornings in the Nile valley prevent accurate observations of
the moment of rising.</p>

<p>Still, as a matter of fact, the Egyptians defined their new
year by the rising of a star, and the length of it by the interval
separating two heliacal risings. Such a year could not be
accurate; and again, as a matter of fact, their correction was
not accurate, for the year was defined now as consisting of 365
days. It seems clear from this that the correction was made
before the solar temples were in use.</p>

<p>In any case the year of 360 days had naturally to give
way, and it ultimately did so, in favour of one of 365. The
precise date of the change is, as we have seen, not known.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The five days were added as epacts or epagomena; the
original months were not altered, but a "little month" of five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248"> 248</span>
days was interpolated at the end of the year between Mesori of
one year and Thoth of the next, as already stated.</p>

<p>When the year of 365 days was established, it was evidently
imagined that finality had been reached; and, mindful of the
confusion which, as we have shown, must have resulted from
the attempt to keep up a year of 300 days by intercalations,
each Egyptian king, on his accession to the throne, bound
himself by oath before the priest of Isis, in the temple of
Ptah at Memphis, not to intercalate either days or months,
but to retain the year of 365 days as established by the
Antiqui.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The text of the Latin translation preserved by
Nigidius Figulus cannot be accurately restored; only thus
much can be seen with certainty.</p>

<p>To retain this year of 365 days, then, became the first law
for the king, and, indeed, the Pharaohs thenceforth throughout
the whole course of Egyptian history adhered to it, in spite
of their being subsequently convinced, as we shall see, of its
inadequacy. It was a Macedonian king who later made an
attempt to replace it by a better one.</p>

<p>We may reckon upon the conservatism of the priests of the
temples retaining the tradition of the old rejected year in every
case. Thus even at Philæ in late times, in the temple of Osiris,
there were 360 bowls for sacrifice, which were filled daily with
milk by a specified rotation of priests. At Acanthus there was
a perforated cask into which one of the 360 priests poured water
from the Nile daily.</p>

<p>Indeed, these temple ceremonials are an evidence of their
antiquity, and the further we put back the change from the 360
to 365 days, the greater the antiquity we must assign to them,
and therefore to the temples themselves.</p>

<small>THE VAGUE AND THE SIRIAN YEARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>During three thousand years of Egyptian history the beginning
of the year was marked by the rising of Sirius, which rising
took place nearly coincidently with the rise of the Nile and the
Summer Solstice.</p>

<p>I have insisted upon the regularity of the rise of the Nile
affording the ancient Egyptians, so soon as this regularity
had been established, a moderately good way of determining
the length of the year, but we have seen they did not so
employ it.</p>

<p>It is also clear that so soon as the greatest northing and
southing of the sun rising or setting at the solstices had been
recognised, and the intervals between them in days had been
counted, a still more accurate way would be open to them.
The solstice <i>must</i> have occurred with greater regularity than the
rise of the river, so that as accuracy of definition became
more necessary the solstice would be preferred. The solstice
was common to all Egypt; the commencement of the inundation
was later as the place of observation was nearer the mouth
of the river. This means they also did not employ, at all
events in the first instance. Of the three coincident, or nearly
coincident, phenomena, the rise of the Nile, the Summer
Solstice, and the rising of Sirius, they at first chose the last.</p>

<p>According to Biot the heliacal rising of Sirius <i>at the solstice</i>
took place on July 20 (Julian), in the year 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and
according to Oppolzer it took place on July 18 (Julian), in the
year 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250"> 250</span></span></p>

<p>But this is too general a statement, and it must be modified
here. There was a difference of seven days in the date of
the heliacal rising, according to the latitude, from southern
Elephantine and Philæ, where the heliacal rising at the solstice
was noted first, to northern Bubastis. There was a difference
of four days between Memphis and Thebes, so that the connection
between the heliacal rising and the solstice depended
simply upon the latitude of the place. The further south, the
earlier the coincidence occurred.</p>

<p>Here we have an <i>astronomical</i> reason for the variation in the
date of New Year's Day.</p>

<p>There no doubt was a time when the Egyptian astronomer-priests
imagined that, by the introduction of the 365-days year,
marking its commencement, as I have said, by the rising of
one of the host of heaven, they had achieved finality. But,
alas, the dream must soon have vanished.</p>

<p>Even with this period of 365 days, the true length of the
year had not been reached; and soon, whether by observations
of the beginning of the inundation, or by observations of the
solstice in some of the solar temples when these had been
built, it was found that there was a difference of a day every
four years between the beginning of the natural and of the
newly-established year, arising, of course, from the fact that
the true year is 365 days <i>and a quarter of a day</i> (roughly) in
length.</p>

<p>With perfectly orientated temples they must have soon
found that their festival at the Summer Solstice&mdash;which festival
is known all over the world to-day&mdash;did not fall precisely on
the day of the New Year, because, if 365 days had exactly
measured the year, that flash of bright sunlight would have
fallen into the sanctuary just as it did 365 days before.
But what they must have found was that, after an interval of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251"> 251</span>
four years, it did not fall on the first day of the month, but
on the day following it.</p>

<table class="standard" summary="">

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p251.jpg" alt="Recurrent 1st of Thoth" />
</div></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The true year and the newly-established year of 365 days,
then, behaved to each other as shown in the following diagram,
when the solstice, representing the beginning of the calendar
year, occurred on the 1st Thoth of the newly-established
calendar year. We should have, in the subsequent years, the
state of things shown in the diagram. The solstice would year
by year occur <i>later</i> in relation to the 1st of Thoth. The 1st
of Thoth would occur <i>earlier</i>, in relation to the solstice; so that
in relation to the established year the solstice would sweep
forwards among the days: in relation to the true year the 1st
of Thoth would sweep backwards.</p>

<p>Let us call the true natural year a <i>fixed</i> year: it is obvious
that the months of the 365-day year would be perpetually
varying their place in relation to those of the fixed year. Let
us, therefore, call the 365-day year a <i>vague</i> year.</p>

<p>Now if the fixed year were exactly 365¼ days long, it is
quite clear that, still to consider the above diagram, the 1st of
Thoth in the vague year would again coincide with the solstice
in 1,460 years, since in four years the solstice would fall on
the 2nd of Thoth, in eight years on the 3rd of Thoth, and so
on (365 × 4 = 1460).</p>

<p>But the fixed year is not 365¼ days long <i>exactly</i>. In the
time of Hipparchus 365·25 did not really represent the true
length of the solar year; instead of 365·25 we must write
365·242392&mdash;that is to say, the real length of the year is a
little <i>less</i> than 365¼ days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252"> 252</span></p>

<p>Now the length of the year being a little <i>less</i>, of course
we should only get a second coincidence of the 1st of Thoth
vague with the solstice in a <i>longer</i> period than the 1460-years
cycle; and, as a matter of fact, 1506 years are required to fit
the months into the years with this slightly shortened length
of the year. In the case of the solstice and the vague year,
then, we have a cycle of 1,506 years.</p>

<p>The variations between the fixed and the vague years were
known perhaps for many centuries to the priests alone. They
would not allow the established year of 365 days, since called
the <i>vague</i> year, to be altered, and so strongly did they feel on
this point that, as already stated, every king had to swear when
he was crowned that he would not alter the year. We can
surmise why this was. It gave great power to the priests; they
alone could tell on what particular day of what particular month
the Nile would rise in each year, because they alone knew in what
part of the cycle they were; and, in order to get that knowledge,
they had simply to continue going every year into their Holy
of Holies one day in the year, as the priests did afterwards in
Jerusalem, and watch the little patch of bright sunlight coming
into the sanctuary. That would tell them exactly the relation
of the true solar solstice to their year; and the exact date of
the inundation of the Nile could be predicted by those who
could determine observationally the solstice, but by no others.</p>

<p>But now suppose that, instead of the solstice, we take the
heliacal rising of Sirius, and compare the successive risings at
the solstice with the 1st of Thoth.</p>

<p>But why, it will be asked, should there be any difference in
the length of the cycles depending upon successive coincidences
of the 1st of Thoth with the solstice and the heliacal rising
of Sirius? The reason is that stars change their places, and
the star to which they trusted to warn them of the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253"> 253</span>
of a new year was, like all stars, subject to the effects brought
about by the precession of the equinoxes. Not for long could
it continue to rise heliacally either at a solstice or a Nile
flood.</p>

<p>Among the most important contributors to the astronomical
side of this subject are M. Biot and Professor Oppolzer. It
is of the highest importance to bring together the fundamental
points which have been made out by their calculations. We
have determinate references to the heliacal rising of Sirius,
to the 1st of Thoth, to the solstice, and to the rising of the
Nile in connection with the Egyptian year; but, so far as I
have been able to make out, we find nowhere at present any
sharp reference to the importance of their correlation with the
times of the <i>tropical</i> year at which these various phenomena
took place. The question has been complicated by the use by
chronologists of the Julian year in such calculations; so the
Julian year and the use made of it by chronologists have to
be borne in mind. Unfortunately, many side-issues have in
this way been raised.</p>

<p>The heliacal rising of Sirius, of course&mdash;if in those days a
true <i>tropical</i> year was being dealt with&mdash;would have given us a
more or less constant variation in the time of the rising over
a long period, <i>on account of its precessional movement</i>; and M.
Biot and others before him have pointed out that the variation,
produced by that movement, in the time of the year at which
the heliacal rising took place was almost exactly equal to the
error of the <i>Julian</i> year as compared with the true tropical or
Gregorian one. The Sirius year, like the Julian, was about
eleven minutes longer than the true year, so that in 3,000 years
we should have a difference of about 23 days. Biot showed by
his calculations, using the solar tables extant before those of
Leverrier, that from 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in the Julian year of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254"> 254</span>
the chronologists, Sirius had constantly, in each year, risen
heliacally on July 20 Julian = June 20 Gregorian. Oppolzer,
more recently, using Leverrier's tables, has made a very slight
correction to this, which, however, is practically immaterial for
the purposes of a general statement. He shows that in the
latitude of Memphis, in 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the heliacal rising took place
on July 18·6, while in the year 0 it took place on July 19·7,
both Julian dates.</p>

<p>The variation from the true tropical year brought about by
the processional movement of Sirius or any other star, however,
can be watched by noting its heliacal rising in relation to any
physical phenomenon which marks the true length of the
tropical year. Such a phenomenon we have in the solstice and
in the rising of the Nile, which, during the whole course of
historical time, has been found to rise and fall with constancy
in each year, the initial rise of the waters, some little way
above Memphis, taking place very nearly at the Summer
Solstice.</p>

<p>Again, M. Biot has made a series of calculations from
which we learn that the heliacal rising of Sirius <span class="allsmcap">AT THE
SOLSTICE</span> occurred on July 20 (Julian) in the year 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
and that in the year 275 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the <i>solstice</i> occurred on June
27 (Julian), while the heliacal <i>rising of Sirius</i> took place, as
before, on July 20 (Julian), so that in Ptolemaic times, at
Memphis, there was a difference of time of about 24 days
between the heliacal rising of Sirius and the solstice, and
therefore the beginning of the Nile flood in that part of the
river. This, among other things, is shown on the next page.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256"> 256</span></p>

<p>We learn from the work of Biot and Oppolzer, then, that the
precessional movement of the star caused successive heliacal
risings of Sirius at the solstice to be separated by almost exactly
365¼ days&mdash;that is, by a greater period than the length of the
true year. So that, in relation to this star, two successive
heliacal risings at the 1st of Thoth vague are represented by a
period of (365¼ × 4 =) 1461 years, while in the case of the
solstices we want 1506.</p>

<p>Now in books on Egyptology the period of 1461 years is
termed the Sothic period, and truly so, as it very nearly
correctly measures the period elapsing between two heliacal
risings at the solstice (or the beginning of the Nile flood) on the
1st of Thoth in the <i>vague</i> year.</p>

<p>But it is merely the result of <i>chance</i> that 365¼ × 4 represents
it. It was not then known that the precessional movement of
Sirius almost exactly made up the difference between the
true length of the year and the assumed length of 365¼
days. It has been stated that this period had not any ancient
existence, but was calculated back in later times. This seems
to me very improbable. I look upon it rather as a true result
of observation, the more so as <i>the period was shortened in later
times</i>, as Oppolzer has shown.</p>

<p>It will be seen that our investigations land us in several
astronomical questions of the greatest interest, and that the
study is one in which modern computations, with the great
accuracy which the work of Leverrier and others gives to them,
can come to the rescue, and eke out the scantiness of the
ancient records.</p>

<p>To consider the subject further, we must pass from the mere
question of the year to that of chronology generally.</p>

<small>THE SOTHIC CYCLE AND THE USE MADE OF IT.</small></h2></div>


<p>Although it is necessary to enter somewhat into the domain of
chronology to really understand the astronomical observations
on which the Egyptian year depended and the uses made of the
year, I shall limit myself to the more purely astronomical part.
To go over the already vast literature is far from my intention,
nor is it necessary to attempt to settle all the differences of
opinion which exist, and which are so ably referred to by Krall
in his masterly analysis,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> to which I own myself deeply indebted.
The tremendously involved state of the problem may
be gathered from the fact that the authorities are not yet
decided whether many of the dates met with in the inscriptions
really belong to a fixed or a vague year!</p>

<p>Let us, rather, put ourselves in the place of the old
Egyptians, and inquire how, out of the materials they had
at hand, a calendar could be constructed in the simplest way.</p>

<p>They had the vague year and the Sirius year, so related, as
we have seen, that the successive coincidences of the 1st Thoth
in both years took place after an interval of 1460 years. Now,
for calendar purposes, they wanted not only to know the days
of the years, but the years of the cycle. This latter is the only
point we need consider here. How were they to do this? The
<i>easiest</i> way would be to conceive a great year or <i>annus magnus</i>,
consisting of 1460 years, each day of which would represent
four years in actual time; and further, to consider everything
that happened, which had to be thus chronicled, to take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258"> 258</span>
on the 1st of Thoth in each year. How would this system
work? During the first four years, at the beginning of a
cycle, the 1st Thoth vague would happen on the 1st Thoth
of the cycle. During the next four years the 1st Thoth of
the vague year would fall on the fifth epact, and so on; so,
as the cycle swept onward, each group of four years would be
marked by a date in the cycle, which would allow the place
of the group of years in the cycle to be exactly defined. But
as the cycle swept onward, the date would sweep backward
among the months of the great sacred year until its end.</p>

<p>To make this clear, it will be well to construct another
diagram somewhat like the former one.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p258" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p258.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE 1ST OF THOTH (REPRESENTING THE RISE OF SIRIUS)
AMONG THE EGYPTIAN MONTHS IN THE 1460-YEAR SOTHIC CYCLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Let us map out the 1460 years which elapsed between two
successive coincidences between the 1st of Thoth in the vague
year and the heliacal rising of Sirius at the solstice, so that we
can see at a glance the actual number of years from any start-point
(= 0) at which the 1st of Thoth in the vague year
occurred successively further and further from the heliacal
rising, until at length, after a period of 1460 years, it coincided
again. As the Sirius-year is longer than the vague one, the
first vague year will be completed before the first Sirius-year,
hence the second vague year will commence just before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259"> 259</span>
end of the fixed year, and that is the reason I have reversed
the order of months in the diagram.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that, if the Egyptians really worked in this
fashion, the date of the heliacal rising of Sirius, given in this
way, would enable us to determine the number of years which
had elapsed from the beginning of the cycle.</p>

<p>This calendar system, it will be seen, is good only for
groups of four years. Now, a system which went no further
than this would be a very coarse one. We find, however, that
special precautions were taken to define which year of the four
was in question, and the fact that this was done goes some
way to support the suggestion I have made. Brugsch,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> indeed,
shows that a special sign was employed to mark the first year
of each series of four.</p>

<p>Next, as a matter of fact it is known (I have the high
authority of Dr. Krall for the statement) that each king was
supposed to begin his reign on the 1st Thoth (or 1st Pachons)
of the particular year in which that event took place, and the
fact that this was so further supports the suggestion we are
considering. During the reign its length and the smaller events
might be recorded in vague years and days so long as the date
of its commencement had been referred to a cycle.</p>

<p>The diagram will show how readily the cycle year can be
determined for any vague year. If, for instance, the 1st Thoth
in the vague year falls on 1 Tybi of the cycle, we see that 980
years must have elapsed since the beginning of the cycle, and
so on.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a true calendar system. If the
Egyptians had not this, what had they?</p>

<p>Dealing, then, with the matter so far as we have gone,
we find that the system suggested enabled the place of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260"> 260</span>
beginning of each vague year and of each king's reign to be
dated in terms of the cycle of 1460 years; and further that,
if they had not such a system as this, they had no means of
recording any lapse of time which exceeded a year. It is not
likely that any nation would put itself in such a position, least
of all the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The existence of periods of 365 years and of 120 years
among the Egyptians is easily explained when the existence of
this great year is recognised; the 365 years' period, marking
approximately the intervals from solstice to equinox and
equinox to solstice, in the natural year.</p>

<p>Let us next try to get a little further by assuming the
supposed method of dating to have been actually employed,
and finding the year of the beginning of one or more of these
cycles thus obtained. This should eventually help us to determine
whether or not the Egyptians acted on this principle, or
used one widely different. In such an investigation as this,
however, we are terribly hampered by the uncertainty of
Egyptian dates; while, as I have said before, there is great
divergence of opinion among Egyptologists as to whether,
from very early times, there was not a true fixed year.</p>

<p>But let us suppose that the vague year was in common
use as a civil year, and that the rising of Sirius started the
year; then, if we can get any accepted date to work with, and
use the diagram to see how many years had elapsed between
that date and the start-point of the cycle, we shall see if there
be any cyclical relation; and if we find it, it will be evidence,
so far as it goes, of the existence not only of a vague year, but
of the mode of reckoning we are discussing.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that there are three references, with
dates given, to the rising of Sirius in widely different times;
and, curiously enough, the month references are nearly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261"> 261</span>
same. I begin with the most recent, as in this case the date
can be fixed with the greater certainty. It is an inscription
at Philæ, described by Brugsch (p. 87), who states that, when
it was written, the 1st of Thoth = 28th of Epiphi. That is,
according to the view we are considering, the heliacal rising of
Sirius&mdash;that is, the 1st Thoth of the vague year fell on the
28th Epiphi of our cycle. He fixes the date of the inscription
between 127 and 117 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Let us take it as 122. Next, referring
to our diagram to find how many years had elapsed
since the beginning of the cycle, we have&mdash;</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">

<th class="tdr">Days.</th>

</tr>
</table>


<p>The cycle, then, began in (118 + 122 =) 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We next find a much more ancient inscription recording the
rising of Sirius on the 28th of Epiphi. Obviously, if the Sothic
cycle had anything to do with the matter, this must have
happened 1458 years earlier, <i>i.e.</i>, about (1458 + 122 =) 1580
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Under which king? Thothmes III., who reigned, according
to Lepsius, 1603-1565 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; according to Brugsch, 1625-1577.
Now, the inscription in question is stated to have been
inscribed by Thothmes III., and, it may be added, on the temple
(now destroyed) at Elephantine.</p>

<p>There is yet another inscription, also known to be of a still
earlier period, referring to the rising of Sirius on the 27th of
Epiphi. We may neglect the difference of one day in the cycle
(representing four years); and again, if the use of the Sothic
cycle were the origin of the identity of dates, we have this
time, according to Oppolzer, a period of 1460 years to add:
this gives us (1580 + 1460 =) 3040 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Again under which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262"> 262</span>
king? Here we are face to face with one of the difficulties of
these inquiries, to which reference has already been made. It
may be stated, however, that the inscription is ascribed to Pepi,
and that, according to various authorities, that king reigned
some time between 3000 and 3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We come, then, to this: that one of the oldest dated inscriptions
known seems to belong to a system which continued
in use at Philæ up to about 100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it was essentially a
system of a vague year, the 1st Thoths of which were represented
as days on a 1460-years' cycle.</p>

<p>Now, assuming that the approximate date of the earliest
inscription is 3044 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and that it represented the heliacal
rising of Sirius on the 27th of Epiphi, the year 3044 must have
been the [(5 + 30 + 3) x 4 =] 152nd after the beginning of the
cycle. The cycle, then, must have commenced (3044 + 152 =)
3196 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>If we assume that the real date of Pepi, who, it is stated,
reigned 100 years, included the year 3044 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it may be, then,
that the inscriptions to which I have directed attention give us
three Sothic cycles beginning&mdash;</p>


<ul class="list">
<li>&nbsp; 122 + 148 =&nbsp; 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
<li>1580 + 148 = 1728 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
<li>3044 + 148 = 3192 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>According to Biot's calculation, the first heliacal rising
of Sirius at the solstice took place in the year 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>;
it is possible, then, that the Egyptians utilised this heliacal
rising within a hundred years of the date on which it would
have been first possible for them to do so. This shows how
keenly alive they were in these matters, and also, I think,
that they had been trained by watching some other star
previously.</p>

<p>It would also follow that the vague year was in common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263"> 263</span>
use. There is ample evidence to show, however, that by
this time the priests were fully acquainted with the true
year, which was called the sacred year, and that every four
years an additional epact was interpolated. Their solar temples,
then, at last had been utilised.</p>

<p>One argument which has been used to show that a vague
year was not in use during the time of the Ramessids has
been derived from some inscriptions at Silsilis which refer
to the dates on which sacred offerings were presented there
to the Nile-god. As the dates 15th of Thoth and 15th of
Epiphi are the same in all three inscriptions, although they
cover the period from Rameses II. to Rameses III.&mdash;120 years&mdash;it
has been argued by Brugsch that a fixed year is in
question.</p>

<p>Brugsch points out that the two dates are separated by 65
days; that this is the exact interval between the Coptic
festivals of the commencement of the flow and the marriage
of the Nile&mdash;the time of highest water; and that, therefore,
in all probability these are the two natural phenomena to
commemorate which the offerings on the dates in question
were made.</p>

<p>But Brugsch does not give the whole of the inscription.
A part of it, translated by De Rougé,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I (the king) know what is said in the depôt of the writings which
are in the House of the Books. The Nile emerges from its fountains to
give the fulness of life-necessaries to the gods," etc.</p>
</div>

<p>De Rougé justly remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Le langage singulier que tient le Pharaon dédicateur pourrait même
faire soupçonner <i>qu'il ne s'agit pas de la venue effective de l'eau sainte du
Nil à l'une des deux dates précitées</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>Krall (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 51) adds the following interesting
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264"> 264</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Consider, now, what these 'Scriptures of the House of Life' were
like. In a catalogue of books from the temple of Edfû we find, besides
a series of purely religious writings, 'The knowledge of the periodical recurrence
of the double stars (sun and moon),' and the 'Law of the periodical
recurrence of the stars.'</p>

<p>" ... The knowledge embodied in these writings dated from the
oldest times of the Egyptian empire, in which the priests placed, rightly
or wrongly, the origin of all their sacred rolls" (<i>cf.</i> Manetho's "History,"
p.130).</p>
</div>

<p>Now, to investigate this question we have to approach
some considerations which at first sight may seem to be
foreign to our subject. I shall be able to show, however,
that this is not so.</p>

<p><i>Imprimis</i> we must remember that it is a question of
Silsilis, where we know, both from tradition and geological
evidence, in ancient times the first cataract was encountered.
The phrase "the Nile emerges from its fountains" would
be much more applicable to Silsilis, the seat of a cataract,
than as it is at present. We do not know when the river made
its way through this impediment, but we do know that after
it took place and the Nile stream was cleared as far as the
cataract that still remains at Elephantine, a nilometer was
erected there, and that during the whole of later Egyptian
history, at all events, the time of the rise of the river has
been carefully recorded both there and at Rôda.</p>

<p>From this it is fair to infer that in those more ancient
times the same thing took place at Silsilis; if this were so, the
reason of the record of the coming of the inundation at Silsilis
is not far to seek, and hence the suggestion lies on the surface
that the records in question may state the date of the arrival
<i>in relation to Memphis time</i>.</p>

<p>It has been rendered, I hope, quite clear in Chapter XXIII.
that there is a difference of fifteen or sixteen days between
the arrival of the inundation at Elephantine and at Memphis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265"> 265</span>
Hence, if in Pepi's time a Nile rise were observed at Silsilis,
there might easily be a difference of fifteen days between the
rise of the Nile at Silsilis and the Memphic 1st of Thoth. If
both at Silsilis and Memphis the Nile rise marked 1st Thoth,
the day of the rise at Memphis would correspond to 15th Thoth
at Silsilis, so that a king reaching Silsilis with Memphis local
time would be struck with this difference, and anxious to record
it. May not this, then, have been the important datum recorded
in the sacred books? If so, it would not touch the
question of the fixed or vague year at all.</p>

<p>Let it, then, be for the present conceded that there was a
vague year, and that at least some of the inscriptions which
suggest the use of only a fixed year in these early times may
be explained in another way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>THE CALENDAR AND ITS REVISION.</small></h2></div>


<p>In the last chapter the so-called Sothic cycle was discussed, and
dates of the commencement of the successive cycles were
suggested.</p>

<p>These dates were arrived at by taking the very simplest
way of writing a calendar in pre-temple times, and using the
calendar inscriptions in the most natural way.</p>

<p>The dates for the coincidence of the heliacal rising of
Sirius and the 1st Thoth of the vague year at, or near, the
solstice, were&mdash;</p>


<ul class="list">
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></span></li>
<li>1728 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
<li>3192 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Here, <i>in limine</i>, we meet with a difficulty which, if it cannot
be explained, evidently proves that the Egyptians did
not construct and use their calendar in the way we have
supposed.</p>

<p>We have it on the authority of Censorinus that a Sothic
period was completed in 139 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and that there was then a
vague year in partial use. It is here that the work of Oppolzer
is of such high value to us; he discussed all the statements
made by Censorinus, and comes to the conclusion that his
account is to be depended upon. It has followed from the
inquiries of chronologists that in this year the 1st of Thoth
took place on July 20 (Julian), the date originally of the
heliacal rising of Sirius, the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>This being so, then, in the year 23 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>&mdash;in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267"> 267</span>
Alexandrine reform of the calendar, of which more presently,
was introduced&mdash;the 1st of Thoth would take place on August
29, a very important date. Censorinus also said that in his
own time (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 238) the 1st of Thoth of the vague year fell on
June 25. The diagram will show the connection of these
three dates in reference to the vague year. The relations of
the statements made as to the years 139 and 238 are very
clearly discussed by Prof. Oppolzer.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_p267" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption">JULIAN DATES OF THE 1ST OF THOTH (VAGUE) FROM 23 A.D. AND 240 A.D.</div>
</div>

<p>Oppolzer, then, being satisfied as to the justice of taking
the year 139 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> as a time of coincidence of the fixed and
vague years&mdash;the latter being determined alone by the heliacal
rising of Sirius, and, be it remembered, not by the solstices&mdash;calculated
with great fulness, using Leverrier's modern values,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268"> 268</span>
the years in which, in the various Egyptian latitudes, chiefly
taking Memphis (lat. 30°) and Thebes (lat. 25°), the coincidence
between the two Thoths occurred in the previous periods
of Egyptian history. He finds these dates for latitude 30°
as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, the date which Oppolzer gives for the coincidence
which is nearest the date we had previously determined at
270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is 139 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> There is a difference of 409 years.</p>

<p>The question is, Can this fundamental difference be explained?
I think it can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269"> 269</span></p>

<p>In the first place, it is beyond doubt that, in the interval
between the Ramessids and the Ptolemies, the calendar, even
supposing the vague year to have been used and to have been
retained, had been fundamentally altered, and the meanings
of the hieroglyphics of the tetramenes had been changed&mdash;in
other words, the designations of the three seasons had been
changed.</p>

<p>On this point I quote Krall<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is well known that the interpretation of the seasons and the months
given by Champollion was opposed by Brugsch, who propounded another,
which is now universally adopted by experts. Something has happened here
which is often repeated in the course of Egyptian history&mdash;the signs have
changed their meaning. Under the circumstance that the vague year during
1461 years wanders through the seasons in a great cycle, it is natural that
the signs for the tetramenes should have changed their significations in the
course of millenniums.</p>

<p>"While Thoth was the first month of the inundation in the documents of
the Thutmosids and Ramessids, we have in the time of the Ptolemies the
month Pachons as the first month of the flood season. Whilst Brugsch's
explanation is valid for the time of the Ramessids, it is not so for that of
the Ptolemies, to which Champollion's view is applicable."</p>
</div>

<p>The signs used for the tetramenes are supposed to represent
water, a field with growing plants, and a barn; the natural
order would be that the first should represent the inundation,
the second the sowing which succeeds it, and the last
harvest-time. If this be conceded, the initial system would
have had the month Thoth connected with the water sign, as
Thoth in early Egyptian times was the first inundation month.
But in the times of the Ramessids even this is not so.
Thoth has the sowing sign assigned to it. In the time of the
Ptolemies the Hood is no longer in Thoth, but in Pachons,
and Pachons has the barn sign attached to it, while the month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270"> 270</span>
Thoth is marked by the water sign, thereby bringing back the
hypothetical relation <i>between the name of the month and the sign</i>,
although, as we have seen, Thoth is no longer the flood month.</p>

<p>Egyptologists declare that all, or at least part, of this change
took place between the periods named; they are undoubtedly
justified as regards a part.</p>

<p>At one point in this interval we are fortunately supplied
with some precise information. In the year 238 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a famous
decree was published, variously called the decree of Canopus
and the decree of Tanis, since it was inscribed on a stone
found there. It is perfectly clear that one of the functions
of this decree was to change, or to approve an already made
change in, the designation of the season or tetramene in which
the inundation commenced, from Thoth to Pachons.</p>

<p>Another function was to establish a fixed year, as we shall
see presently. We must assume, then, that a vague year was in
vogue prior to the decree. Now the decree tells us that at its
date the heliacal rising of Sirius took place on 1 Payni. Assuming
that this date had any relation to the system we have been
considering, the cycle to which it belonged must have begun</p>


<ul class="list">
<li>Days.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5 Epacts</span></li>
<li>30 Mesori</li>
<li>30 Epiphi</li>
<li>30 Payni</li>
<li>&mdash;</li>
<li>95 × 4 = 380 years previously&mdash;that is, in the year 618 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Here at first sight it would seem that the Sothic cycles
we have been considering have no relation to the one now in
question; for, according to my view, the last Sothic cycle
began in 1728 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> A little consideration, however, will lead
to the contrary view, and show that the time about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
was very convenient for a revision of the calendar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271"> 271</span></p>

<p>In the first place, nearly a month now elapsed between the
coming of the flood and the heliacal rising; and in the second,
by making the year for the future <i>to begin with the flood</i>, a change
might be made involving tetramenes only.</p>

<p>when starting fresh, he would seize the opportunity of effecting
a change, not only by dealing with a tetramene, but he would
change the names of the tetramenes allocated to the signs; as
Krall remarks, it was almost merely a question of a change
of the sign! It really was more, because the new tetramene
began with the flood.</p>

<p>Assuming this, we can see exactly what was done in 238

<p>To sum up, so far as we have gone, we have the three inscriptions
at Philæ, Elephantine and the still more ancient one
of Pepi (?), indicating on the simple system we have suggested
beginnings of Sothic cycles on the 1st Thoth about the years</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the decree of Canopus, giving
us by exactly the same system a local revision of the calendar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273"> 273</span>
about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> I say <i>about</i> 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> because it must be remembered
that a difference of 2½ days in the phenomena observed
will make a difference of 10 years in the date, and we do not
know in what part of the valley the revision took place, and
therefore at what precise time in relation to the heliacal rising
the Nile-rise was observed.</p>

<p>Whenever presumably it took place, New Year's Day was
reckoned by the Flood, and the rising of Sirius followed nearly,
if not quite, a month afterwards. The equivalent of the old
1st Thoth was therefore 1 Payni. In months, then, the old 1st
Thoth was separated from the new one (= 1 Payni) by three
months (Payni, Mesori, Epiphi) and the Epacts.</p>

<p>In this way, we can exactly account for the difference of
409 years referred to above as the dates assigned by Censorinus
and myself for the beginning of the Sirius cycle.</p>

<p>The difference of two years is equal only to half a day!</p>

<p>It seems, then, pretty clear from this that the suggestion I
have ventured to make on astronomical grounds may be worth
consideration on the part of Egyptologists. If our inquiries
have really led us to the true beginnings of the Sothic periods,
it is obvious that those who informed Censorinus that the year
139 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> was the end of a cycle <i>omitted to tell him what we now
can learn from the decree of Tanis</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>THE FIXED YEAR AND FESTIVAL CALENDARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>The reformation of the Egyptian calendar, to be gathered, as I
suggested in the last chapter, from the decree of Tanis, is not,
however, the point to which reference is generally made in connection
with the decree. The attempt recorded by it to get rid
of the vague year is generally dwelt on.</p>

<p>Although the system of reckoning which was based on
the vague year had advantages with which it has not been
sufficiently credited, undoubtedly it had its drawbacks.</p>

<p>The tetramenes, with their special symbolism of flood-, seed-,
and harvest-time, had apparently all meant each in turn; however
the meanings of the signs were changed, the "winter
season" occurred in this way in the height of summer, the
"sowing-time" when the whole land was inundated and there
was no land to plant, and so on. Each festival, too, swept
through the year. Still, it is quite certain that information was
given by the priests each year in advance, so that agriculture
did not suffer; for if this had not been done, the system,
instead of dying hard, as it did, would have been abolished
thousands of years before.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to state shortly what happened with regard
to the fixing of the year, it will be convenient here to state a
suggestion that has occurred to me, on astronomical grounds,
with regard to the initial change of sign.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that in the old tables of the months, instead
of Sirius leading the year, we have Teχi with the two feathers
of Amen. In later times this is changed to Sirius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275"> 275</span></p>

<p>I believe it is generally acknowledged that the month-table
at the Ramesseum is the oldest one we have; there is a variant
at Edfû. They both run as follows, and no doubt they had
their origin when a 1st Thoth coincided with an heliacal rising
and Nile flood.</p>

<p>I am informed that Teχi, in the above month-list, has some
relation to Thoth. In the early month-list the goddess is represented
with the two feathers of Amen, and in this early stage I
fancy we can recognise her as Amen-t; but in later copies of
the table the symbol is changed to that of <i>Sirius</i>. This, then,
looks like a change of cult depending upon the introduction of
a new star&mdash;that is, a star indicating by its heliacal rising the
Nile-rise after the one first used had become useless for such a
purpose.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE MONTH-TABLE AT THE RAMESSEUM.</div>
</div>

<p>I have said that the Ramesseum month-list is probably the
oldest one we have. It is considered by some to date only from
Rameses II., and to indicate a fixed year; such, however, is not
Krall's opinion.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276"> 276</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The latest investigations of Dümichen show
that the calendar of Medînet-Habû is only a copy of
the original composed under Ramses II. about 120
years before....</p>

<p>"But the true original of the calendar of Medînet-Habû
does not even date from the time of Ramses II.
It is known to every Egyptologist how little the
time of the Ramessids produced what was truly
original, how much just this time restricted itself to
a reproduction of the traditions of previous generations.
In the calendar of Medînet-Habû we have
(p. 48) not a fixed year instituted under Ramses II.,
but the normal year of the old time, the vague year,
as it was, to use Dschewhari's words quoted above
(p. 852) in the first year of its institution, the year
as it was before the Egyptians had made two unwelcome
observations: First, that the year of 365
days did not correspond to the reality, but shifted by
one day in four years with regard to the seasons;
secondly&mdash;which, of course, took a much longer time&mdash;that
the rising of Sirius ceased to coincide with
the beginning of the Nile flood.</p>

<p>"We are led to the same conclusion by a consideration
of the festivals given in the calendar of
Medînet-Habû. They are almost without exception
the festivals which we have found in our previous
investigation of the calendars of Esne and Edfû
to be attached to the same days. We know
already the Uaya festival of the 17th and 18th
Thoth, the festival of Hermes of the 19th Thoth,
the great feast of Amen beginning on the 19th
Paophi, the Osiris festivals of the last decade of
Choiak, and that of the coronation of Horuz on the
1st Tybi.</p>

<p>"Festivals somehow differing from the ancient
traditions and general usage are unknown in the
calendar of Medînet-Habû, and it is just such festivals
which have enabled us to trace fixed years in the
calendars of Edfû and Esne.</p>

<p>"We are as little justified in considering the
mythologico-astronomical representations and inscriptions
on the graves of the time of the Ramessids as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277"> 277</span>
founded on a fixed year, as we can do this in the case of the Medînet-Habû
calendar. In this the astronomical element of the calendar is quite overgrown
by the mythological. Not only was the daily and yearly course of the sun a most
important event for the Egyptian astronomer, but the priest also had in his
sacred books many mythological records concerning the god Rā, which had to be
taken into account in these representations. The mythological ideas dated from
the oldest periods of Egyptian history; we shall therefore be obliged, for their
explanation, not to remain in the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ,
but to ascend into previous centuries. <i>I should think about the middle of the
fourth millennium before Christ, that is the time at which the true original of the
Medînet-Habû calendar was framed.</i> Further, we must in these mythological and
astronomical representations not overlook the fact that we cannot expect them
to show mathematical accuracy&mdash;that, on the contrary, if that is a consideration,
we must proceed with the greatest caution. We know now how inexact were the
representations and texts of tombs, especially where the Egyptian artist could
suppose that no human eye would inspect his work; we also know how often
representations stop short for want of room, and how much the contents were
mutilated for the sake of symmetry."</p>

<p>There is also, as I have indicated, temple evidence that
Sirius was not the first star utilised as a herald of sunrise. We
have, then, this possibility to explain the variation from the
true meaning of the signs in Ramessid times. And it may be
gathered from this that the calendar was reorganised<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>

<p>The revision of 618 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was not universally accepted, so
from that time onward there was an old and a new style in
force.</p>

<p>Before I pass on, it may be convenient, in connection
with the above month-tables, to refer in the briefest way to
the mythology relating to the yearly movement of the sun,
in order to show that when this question is considered at
all, if it helps us with regard to the mythology connected
with the rising and setting of stars, it will as assuredly help
us with regard to the mythology of the various changes
which occur throughout the year.</p>

<p>We have, as we have seen, in the Egyptian year really
the prototype of our own. The Egyptians, thousands of
years ago, had an almost perfect year containing twelve
months; but, instead of four seasons, they had three&mdash;the
time of the sowing, the time of the harvest, and the time of
the inundation. Unfortunately, at various times in Egyptian
history, the symbols for the tetramenes seem to have got
changed.</p>

<p>The above-given inscriptions show that they had a distinct
symbolism for each of the months. Gods or goddesses
are given for ten months out of the twelve, and where we
have not these we have the hippopotamus (or the pig) and
the jackal, two circumpolar constellations. I think there is
no question that we are dealing here with these constellations,
though the figures have been supposed to represent something
quite different.</p>

<p>There are also myths and symbols of the twelve changes
during the twelve hours of the day; the sun being figured as
a child at rising, as an old man when setting in the evening.
These ideas were also transferred to the annual motion of the
sun. In Macrobius, as quoted by Krall, we find the statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280"> 280</span>
that the Egyptians compared the yearly course of the sun
also with the phases of human life.</p>

<table class="standard" summary="">

<p>With the day of the Summer Solstice the sun reaches
the greatest northern rising amplitude, and at the Winter
Solstice its greatest southern amplitude. By the solstices the
year is divided into two approximately equal parts; during
one the points of rising move southwards, during the other
northwards.</p>

<p>This phenomenon, it is stated, was symbolised by the two
eyes of Rā, the so-called Utchats, which look in different
directions. They appear as representing the sun in the two
halves of the year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have next to discuss the fixed year, to which the
Egyptian chronologists were finally driven in later Egyptian
times. The decree of Tanis was the true precursor of the Julian
correction of the calendar. In consequence of this correction
we now add a day every four years to the end of February.
The decree regulated the addition, by the Egyptians, of a day
every four years by adding a day to the epacts, which were
thus six every four years instead of being always five, as they
had been before.</p>

<p>In fact, it replaced the vague year by the sacred year long
known to the priests.</p>

<p>But if everything had gone on then as the priests of Tanis
imagined, the Egyptian New Year's Day, <i>if</i> determined by the
heliacal rising of Sirius, would not always afterwards have been
the 1st of Payni, although the solstice and Nile flood would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281"> 281</span>
have been clue at Memphis about the 1st of Pachons; and this
is, perhaps, one among the reasons why the decree was to a
large extent ignored.</p>

<p>Hence, for some years after the date of the decree of Tanis,
there were at least three years in force&mdash;the new fixed year,
the new vague year, reckoning from Pachons, and the old
vague year, reckoning from Thoth.</p>

<p>But after some years another attempt was made to get rid
of all this confusion. The time was 23 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, 216 years after
the decree of Tanis, and the place was Alexandria. Hence
the new fixed year introduced is termed the Alexandrine
year.</p>

<p>This new attempt obviously implied that the first one had
failed; and the fact that the vague year was continued in
the interval is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that the
new year was 216∕4 = 54 days <i>en retard</i>. In the year of Tanis it
is stated that the 1st Pachons, the new New Year's Day, the
real beginning of the Hood, fell on the 19th of June (Gregorian),
the Summer Solstice, and hence the 1st of Thoth fell on the
22nd of October (Gregorian). In the Alexandrine year the
22nd of October is represented by the 29th of August, and the
19th of June by the 20th of April.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in the Alexandrine year the heliacal
rising of Sirius on the 23rd of July (Julian) falls on the 29th
of Epiphi, nearly the same date as that to which I first drew
attention in the inscriptions of the date of Thothmes and Pepi.
This, however, it is now clearly seen, is a pure accident, due
to the break of continuity before the Tanis year, and the <i>slip</i>
between that and the Alexandrine one. It is important to
mention this, because it has been thought that somehow the
"Alexandrine year" was in use in Pepi's time.</p>

<p>It would seem that the Alexandrine revision was final,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282"> 282</span>
and that the year was truly fixed, and from that time to
this it has remained so, and must in the future for ever
remain so. It must never be forgotten that we owe this perfection
to the Egyptian Festival Calendars.</p>

<p>One of the chief uses of the Egyptian calendar that has
come down to us was the arrangement and dating of the
chief feasts throughout the year in the different temples.</p>

<p>The fact that the two great complete feast-calendars of
Edfû and Esne refer to the only fixed years evidenced by
records&mdash;those of Tanis and Alexandria&mdash;one of which was
established over 200 years after the other, is of inestimable
value for the investigation of the calendar and chronology of
ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>In an excellent work of Brugsch, "Three Festival Calendars
from the Temple of Apollinopolis Magna (Edfû) in Upper
Egypt," we have two calendars which we can refer to fixed
years, and can date with the greatest accuracy. In the case
of one of these, that of Esne, this is universally recognised;
as to the other, that of Apollinopolis Magna, we are indebted
to the researches of Krall, who points out, however, that "it
is only when the province of Egyptian mythology has been
dealt with in all directions that we can undertake a successful
explanation of the festival catalogues. Even externally they
show the greatest eccentricities, which are not diminished,
but increased, on a closer investigation."</p>

<p>About some points, however, there is no question. The
Summer Solstice is attached in the Edfû calendar to the 6th
Pachons, according to Krall, while the beginning of the flood
is noted on the 1st of that month. In the Esne calendar the
26th Payni is New Year's Day. We read:&mdash;"26th Payni, New
Year's Day, Feast of the Revelation of Kahi in the Temple.
To dress the crocodiles, as in the month of Menchir, day 8."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283"> 283</span></p>

<p>Peculiar to the Esne calendar, according to Krall, is the
mentioning of the "New Years Festival of the Ancestors" on
the 9th of Thoth; to the Edfû calendar, publication No. 1 of
Brugsch, the festival "of the offering of the first of the
harvested fruits, after the precept of King Amenemha I.," on
the 1st Epiphi, and "the celebration of the feast of the Great
Conflagration" on the 9th of Menchir. In feast-calendar No. 1,
the reference to the peculiar Feast of Set is also remarkable;
this was celebrated twice, first in the first days of Thoth
(? 9th), then, as it appears, in Pachons (10th). This feast is
well known to have been first mentioned under the old Pharaoh
Pepi Merinrā.</p>

<p>It is a question whether in the new year of the ancestors
and the feasts of Set, all occurring about the 9th Thoth and
Pachons, we have not Memphis festivals which gave way to
Theban ones; for, so far as I can make out, the flood takes
about nine days to pass from Thebes to Memphis, so that in
Theban time the arrival of the flood at Memphis would occur
on 9th or 10th Thoth. There is no difficulty about the second
dating in Pachons, for, as we have seen, this followed on the
reconstruction of the calendar.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of note that the feast of the "Great
Conflagration" took place very near the Spring Equinox.</p>

<p>Let us dwell for a moment on the Edfû inscriptions to
see if we can learn from them whether or not they bear out the
views brought forward with regard to this reconstruction.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it is now acknowledged that the temple
inscriptions at Edfû (which are stated to have been cut between
117 and 81 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>) are based upon the fixed year of Tanis; hence
we should expect that the rising of Sirius would be referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284"> 284</span>
on 1 Payni, and this is so. But here, as in the other temples,
we get double dates referring to the old calendars, and we find
the "wounding of Set" referred to on the 1st Epiphi and
the rising of Sirius referred to under 1 Mesori. Now this
means, if the old vague year is referred to, as it most probably
is, that</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5 Epacts</span></li>
<li>30 Mesori</li>
<li>&mdash;</li>
<li>35 × 4 = 140 years</li>
</ul>

<p>had elapsed since the beginning of a Sothic cycle, when the
calendar coincidences were determined, which were afterwards
inscribed on the temple walls. We have, then, 140 years to
subtract from the beginning of the cycle in 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This
gives us 130 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it will be seen that this agrees as closely
as can be expected with my view, whereas the inscription has
no meaning at all if we take the date given by Censorinus.</p>

<p>I quote from Krall<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> another inscription common to Edfû
and Esne, which seems to have astronomical significance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1. Phamenoth. Festival of the suspension of the sky by Ptah, by the side
of the god Harschaf, the master of Heracleopolis Magna (Al). Festival of Ptah.
Feast of the suspension of the sky (Es).</p>

<p>"Under the 1st Phamenoth, Plutarch, <i>de Iside et Osiride</i>, c. 43, b, notices the
ἔμβασις Ὀσίριδος εἰς τὴν σελὴνην. These are festivals connected with the celebration
of the Winter Solstice, and the filling of the Uza-eye on the 30th Menchir.
Perhaps the old year, which the Egyptians introduced into the Nile valley at the
time of their immigration, and which had only 360 days, commenced with the
Winter Solstice. Thus we should have in the 'festival of the suspension of the
sky,' by the ancient god Ptah&mdash;venerated as creator of the world&mdash;a remnant of
the time when the Winter Solstice ... marked the beginning of the year,
and also the creation."</p>
</div>

<p>The reconstruction of the calendar naturally enhanced the
importance of the month Pachons; this comes out very clearly
from the inscriptions translated by Brugsch. On this point
Krall remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285"> 285</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is, therefore, quite right that the month Pachons, <i>which took the
place of the old Thoth by the decree of Tanis</i>, should play a prominent part in
the feast-calendars of the days of the Ptolemies, and the first period of
the Empire in general, but especially in the <i>Edfû</i> calendar, which refers
to the <i>Tanitic</i> year. The first five days of Pachons are dedicated in our
calendar to the celebration of the subjection of the enemies by Horus;
we at once remember the above-mentioned (p. 7) record of Edfû of the
nature of a mythological calendar, describing the advent of the Nile
flood. On the 6th of Pachons&mdash;remember the great importance of the
sixes in the Ptolemæan records&mdash;the solstice is then celebrated. The Uza-eye
is then filled, a mythical act which we have in another place referred
to the celebration of the solstice, and 'everything is performed
which is ordained' in the book 'on the Divine Birth.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Next let us turn to Esne. The inscriptions here are stated
to be based on the Alexandrine year, but we not only find
1st Thoth given as New Year's Day, but 26 Payni given as
the beginning of the Nile flood.</p>

<p>Now I have, already stated that the Alexandrine year was
practically a fixing of the vague Tunis year&mdash;that is, a year
beginning on 1st Pachons in 239 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>If we assume the date of the calendar coincidences recorded
at Esne to have been 15 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (we know it was after
23 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and at the end of the Roman dominion), we have as
before, seeing that, if the vague Tunis year had really
continued, it would have swept forward with regard to the
Nile flood,</p>


<ul class="list">
<li>Pachons 30</li>
<li>Payni &nbsp; &nbsp; 26</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.8em;">&mdash;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.8em;">56 × 4 = 224 years after 239 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></span></li>
</ul>


<p>This double dating, then, proves the continuation of the vague
year of Tunis if the date 15 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> of the inscription is about
right.</p>

<p>Can we go further and find a trace of the old cycle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286"> 286</span>
beginning 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>? In this case we should have the rising
of Sirius</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">270</span></li>
<li>&nbsp;- 15</li>
<li>—&mdash;</li>
<li>4)255 years</li>
<li>—&mdash;</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">64 = say, five Epacts and two months.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This would give us 1 Epiphi. Is this mentioned in the
Esne calendar? Yes, it is, "1 Epiphi. To perform the
precepts of the book on the second divine birth of the child
Kahi."</p>

<p>Now the 26th Payni, the new New Year's Day, is associated
with the "revelation of Kahi," so it is not impossible
that "the second divine birth" may have some dim reference
to the feast.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to pursue this intricate subject further
in this place; so intricate is it that, although the suggestions
I have ventured to make on astronomical grounds
seem consistent with the available facts, they are suggestions
only, and a long labour on the part of Egyptologists will
be needed before we can be said to be on firm ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>THE MYTHOLOGY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.</small></h2></div>


<p>A long parenthesis has been necessary in order to inquire
fully into the yearly festivals of the Egyptian priests, the
relation of the feasts to the rising of stars, and the difficulties
which arose from the fact that a true year was not in use till
quite late.</p>

<p>It is now time to return to the subject-matter of Chapters
XIX.-XXII. in order to show that since the goddesses
chiefly worshipped at Denderah and Thebes were goddesses
whose cult was associated with the year, it is open to us to
inquire whether we may not use the facts with which we are
now familiar to obtain a general idea of that part of mythology
which refers to them.</p>

<p>I will begin by taking a certain group of goddesses.</p>

<p>1. <i>There is evidence that many of the goddesses under discussion
personified stars in exactly the same way that Isis personified Sirius
and Mut</i> γ <i>Draconis.</i>&mdash;If we leave Denderah and Thebes
for the moment, and consider the pyramid region of Gîzeh,
we find that the temples there, which are associated with
each of the pyramids, are not oriented to Sirius; but yet they
are temples of Isis, pointing due east; therefore they could
not have pointed to the same Isis worshipped at Denderah,
or the same Hathor worshipped at Thebes.</p>

<p>Thus, in the case of the temple of Mut at Thebes, of Isis
at Denderah, and the temples of Isis at the pyramids, and in
many towns facing East, obviously different stars were in
question, whatever the mythology might have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288"> 288</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_p288" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p288.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">BLACK GRANITE STATUE OF SEKHET FROM THE TEMPLE OF MUT AT THEBES.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289"> 289</span></p>

<p>Further, it seems quite certain that the star symbolised as
Isis in the pyramid worship was the star Antares (Serk-t) heralding
the autumnal equinox, and it is probable that the Pleiades
(Nit) were so used at the vernal equinox.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p289" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p289.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="gap4r"> THE GODDESS TAURT.</span>      THE GODDESS SERK-T OR SELK-T.
(<i>Both with horns and disk.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>2. <i>There is evidence that many of the names of these goddesses are
pure synonyms.</i>&mdash;That is to say, we have the same goddess (or
the same star) called different names in different
places, and associated with different animal
emblems, in consequence of the existence of
different totems in different nomes. I have already referred
to the symbolism of the goddess Mut. In one form she
is a hippopotamus; in another she has a cow's horns and
disk. The temple of Hathor at Denderah was probably associated
with the crocodile or the hippopotamus; so that from
the symbolism referred to we get the suggestion that the
goddess Mut was really the Theban form of the goddess
Hathor at Denderah. There is another delineation which
shows that even more clearly: it is a drawing of the goddess
with both the lion's and crocodile's head. One of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290"> 290</span>
wonderful things to be seen at Thebes is that marvellous
collection of the statues of Sechet in the temple of Mut, all of
them lion-headed. From evidence of this kind in addition to
the temple inscriptions already referred to, we get a clear
indication of the fact that Apet, Mut, Taurt, Sechet, Bast,
were the same goddess under different names, and I may add
that they, in all probability, symbolised the star γ Draconis.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p290" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p290.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="gap6r">NIT.</span>  <span class="gap6r">NIT (ANOTHER FORM).</span>   BAST.</div>
</div>

<p>3. <i>All these goddesses have a special symbol.</i>&mdash;Hathor wears
the cow's head and the horns with the disk. Taurt, the
hippopotamus-goddess, is also represented with horns and
disk. The horns and disk are also worn by Serk-t, Sati and
Rā-t, the wife of the sun-god Rā; many other goddesses might
be added to this list. Indeed, it looks as if all the goddesses
who are stated to be variants either of Isis or Hathor have this
same symbol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291"> 291</span></p>

<p>This generic symbolism suggests that the names Isis and
Hathor are themselves generalisations, meaning an accompaniment
of sunrise, whether that light be the dawn, or an
heliacally-rising star, or even the moon. The generic symbol
is the sun's disk and horns, which, I think, may not impossibly
be a poetic development of the sign for sunrise. Isis and
Hathor are two different ways of defining or thinking about
a rising star&mdash;that is, a star heralding the sunrise, for such
were the rising stars <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_p291" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p291.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="gap8r">ANUQA.</span>   SATI.</div>
</div>

<p>All the goddesses so symbolised are either different forms
of Isis or Hathor, or represent goddesses who personify or
bring before us mythologically stars the rising of which was
observed at the dawn at some time of the year or another.</p>

<p>But it must be added that these goddesses are not always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292"> 292</span>
represented with this head-gear, possibly because they had
other functions besides their astronomical one.</p>

<p>The extent of this variation may be gathered from the two
forms of Neith or Nit given on page 290.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p292" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p292.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ISIS NURSING HORUS.
(The last form is Serk-t-Isis, the scorpion goddess.)</div>
</div>

<p>4. <i>Many of the goddesses are represented as Isis nursing Horus.</i>&mdash;It
is very important not to forget that stars were chiefly
observed rising in the dawn, and that mythologically such an
event was represented by the Egyptians as Isis (the rising
star-goddess) nursing Horus (the rising sun-god). The sun
was supposed to be a youth in the morning, to be very young
therefore at the moment of rising, and the goddess Isis was
supposed to be then nursing him. Many of the goddesses are
thus portrayed. I may mention Renen-t, Serk-t, Rā-t, Amen-t,
as instances. Thus I hold that we get in this series of
goddesses the statement, put mythologically, that certain stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293"> 293</span>
to which the goddesses were sacred rose heliacally at some
time of the year or another. Of course the record is far from
complete, and probably it will become more complete when
inquiries are made from this point of view. The original
symbolism is that Isis or Hathor is a star rising in the dawn,
watching over the sun or taking him from his cradle; and the
young Horus, the rising sun, is, of course, the son of Isis. The
emblem of the mother and child is thus shown to have been in
established use for the expression of high religious thought at
least 5000 years ago.</p>

<p>These and other facts may be brought together in a
tabular form, to show what apparently the complete mythology
of Isis meant.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the case of Isis we are not dealing
merely with a rising star, while, so far as I know, Hathor is
limited to stars.</p>

<p>If we accept the general statement regarding Isis, namely,
that it was a term applied to anything appearing to the eastward
and heralding sunrise, many of our difficulties at once disappear.
The Isis of the pyramid-temples and of the smaller
temple of Denderah symbolised different celestial bodies, though
they served the same purpose. The Hathor of the greater
temple of Denderah, and the Hathor of Dêr el-Bahari,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294"> 294</span>
symbolised different celestial bodies, but their function was
the same. On the other hand, the Hathor of Denderah and
the Mut of Thebes were neither different divinities, nor did
they personify different stars; they were simply local names
of γ Draconis.</p>

<p>We are thus enabled to understand the doubling of the
symbolism in the case of Hathor. The hippopotamus and
the cow generically are dealt with as rising stars; specifically
we deal with γ Draconis in one case, and Sirius in the other.</p>

<p>The evidence goes to show that these two stars were those
to the risings of which very great importance was attached,
but they did not stand alone. We get another form of
Isis (referring, it is possible, to the star α Columbæ, before
even Sirius was used), so that we have a northern star and a
southern star observed at the same time&mdash;the two eyes of Rā.
Idle other goddesses which have not yet been worked out
probably refer to one or other of these stars, or to others which
lie more to the south. These are represented rather in the
temples above the first cataract than in those below. This fact
will be enlarged upon in the sequel.</p>

<p>The study of orientation, then, combined with mythology,
supplies us with other rising stars besides Sirius, and, indeed,
although the date given by Riot for the first heliacal rising
of Sirius at the solstice&mdash;3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;seems a very remote one,
it is practically certain that α Columbæ was previously used,
because before that time it was conveniently situated to
give warning of the sunrise at the Summer solstice, as Sirius
was subsequently. The worship would be kept up after the
utility had gone.</p>

<p>Dümichen's view with regard to the local cult of Hathor
and its astronomical origin is not very different from mine.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295"> 295</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Der Cult der Göttin Hathor geht in die ältesten Zeiten der ägyptischen
Geschichte zurück. Schon die Pyramideninschriften erwälmen eine Heliopolitische
Hathor und Priester und Priesterinnen dieser Göttin werden in
denselben Grabkapellen nicht selten genannt. Die Hathor war keine speciell
lokalisirte Gottheit, sondern eine allgemein in sämmtlichen Tempeln Aegyptens
verehrte Form eines Cultes, dessen Urgedanke, im weitesten Sinne, die Auffassung
des weiblichen Principes gegenuber dem männlichen Principe der
Gottheit war. In dieser Auffassung erscheint sie geradezu identisch mit der
Isis, weshalb auch beiden Göttinnen die Kuh das geheiligte Thier war. Da in
jeder Stadt, vor allen aber in jeder Nomos-Hauptstadt eine Hathor als Schutzgöttin
des betreffenden Ortes aufgeführt wird, so ist es erklärlich, dass die lokalen
Formen dieser Göttin in den Inschriften der Tempel in grösster Anzahl aufgeführt
werden. Im Tempel von Edfu werden Beispiels halber an der Decke des
Pronaos über 300 Namen der Göttin mit ihren lokalen Beziehungen hergezählt
mit besonderer Bevorzugung derjenigen lokalen Formen, welche in den einzelnen
Nomos-Hauptstädten sich eines hervorragenden Cultes erfreuten. Die letzteren
berühren vorzüglich eine Sieben-Zahl von Hathoren, welche als die grossen
bezeichnet werden und von denen fast in allen grösseren Tempeln Listen an den
Wänden zu lesen sind.</p>

<p>"In der älteren Zeit bezeichnet Hathor einen kosmischen Urbegriff. Schon
ihr Name verräth aufs Deutlichste die kosmogonische Wurzel. Ha. t. hor
wörtlich übersetzt "Wolnung des Horus&mdash;Behausung Gottes" d. i. die Welt, die
Darstellung Gottes in der sichtbaren Welt, die Natur, in welcher die Gottheit
wirksam ist."<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Before I pass on, it will, I think, be well to point out that
the argument I have used to show that Isis was really a generic
name is enforced when we consider the allied points relating to
Osiris.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that some of the gods symbolised setting
stars. We already know that the setting sun became Osiris,
Atmu, or Tmu, and, whatever the names, they were all
represented as mummies. But the sun was not the only
body that was symbolised as Osiris; the moon and stars were
at times symbolised in the same way. We may, indeed,
venture to make the following generalised statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be observed with what fulness the antithesis of Isis
is indicated.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that the possible temple of
Osiris at the pyramids points to the westward, but our
special reference now is to stars. When we come to look for
this mummy-symbolism among the gods other than sun-gods (it
is entirely and remarkably absent among the goddesses), we
find Khons, Ptah, and Khem pictured as mummies; that is,
they become a sort of Osiris. Supposing that these gods were
worshipped, there would probably be temples dedicated to
them; still, the absence of such temples would not be decisive,
since they might have been destroyed. However, very fortunately
for this inquiry, there are two temples still extant at
Thebes, known as the temples of Khons and Ptah. If there is
anything, then, in the idea that there must be some relation
with the western horizon in the case of these gods represented
as mummies, these temples should point to the west. <i>They do
point to the west.</i></p>

<p>Very fortunately, also, these temples have a pretty good
history: that is, one knows, within some hundreds of years at
all events, when they were founded. Therefore, by help of
those astronomical methods to which I have previously referred,
it is not difficult to get at the stars. They turn out to be a
southern star&mdash;Canopus&mdash;in the case of the temple of Khons,
and Capella in the case of the temple of Ptah. Now, there
is another very important temple at Thebes, it is a temple
without a name, at right angles to the temple of Mut. This
also points to the west. Although the evidence is not complete,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297"> 297</span>
it clearly suggests that this temple was dedicated to the god
Min or Khem, and was oriented to the star Spica; so that
at Thebes alone it looks as if the three gods represented by
mummies&mdash;different stellar forms of Osiris&mdash;Khons, Ptah and
Min, have all been run to earth in the three stars Canopus,
Capella, and Spica.</p>

<p><i>Provisionally, we way hazard the assertion that the mummy
form marks a setting star, as the horns and disk mark a rising one.
We get the antithesis between Osiris and Isis.</i></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p297.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ISIS, OSIRIS AND HORUS.</div>
</div>

<p>We gather, then, that the wonderful old-world myth of Isis
and Osiris is astronomical from beginning to end, although
Osiris in this case is not the sun, but the moon. But I have not
yet finished with the mummy form; the waning moon is also
Osiris. It is supposed to be dying from the time of full moon
to new moon. The Egyptians in their mythology were nothing
if not consistent; the moon was called Osiris from the moment
it began to wane, as the sun was Osiris so soon as it began to
set. A constellation paling at sunrise was also Osiris.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299"> 299</span></p>

<p>I have previously noted the symbolism of Sirius-Hathor as
a cow in a boat associated with the constellation of Orion.
There is a point connected with this which I did not then refer
to, but which is of extreme importance for a complete discussion
of the question now occupying us. We get associated with the
cow in the boat, Orion (Sah) as Horus, but in other inscriptions
we get Orion as a mummy&mdash;that is to say, in the course of
Egyptian history the same constellation is symbolised as a rising
sun at one time and a setting sun at another. Now, that must
have been so if the Egyptian mythology were consistent and
rested on an astronomical basis, because Sah rose in the dawn in
one case and faded at dawn in the other. From the table giving
a generalised statement with regard to Osiris, similar to that we
have already considered for Isis, it looks as if the mythology
connected with Osiris is simply the mythology connected with
any celestial body becoming invisible. We have the sun setting,
the moon waning, a planet setting, stars setting, constellations
fading at dawn. We see, therefore, that the Egyptian mythology
was absolutely and completely consistent with the astronomical
conditions by which they were surrounded; that, although it is
wonderfully poetical, in no case is the poetry allowed to interfere
with the strictest and most accurate reference to the
astronomical phenomena which had to be dealt with.</p>

<p>The argument, then, for the use of Isis as a generic name
is greatly strengthened by the similar way in which the term
Osiris, which is acknowledged to be a generic name, is
employed.</p>

<p>Now to return to Denderah in the light of the preceding
discussion. A curious and interesting thing is that we find that
the temple of <i>Isis</i>, which is very much ruined, does not contain
emblems of the Sirius worship; but that all these appear in the
temple of <i>Hathor</i>, which, of course, pointing as it does to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300"> 300</span>
north-east, could never have received any light from a star
south of the equator. There has been a change of cult.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the temple of Isis presents so many
emblems thought to relate to the worship connected with
γ Draconis, to which the temple of Hathor was in all
probability directed, that it was named the Typhoneum by
the French Commission.</p>

<p>There has been an apparent change of <i>rôle</i> and cult, due
either to the fact that in time the observation of the rising
of Sirius superseded that of the rising of γ Draconis, or that
the worship of Set was replaced.</p>

<p>With regard to this change of cult, we moderns should have
no difficulty. We go to Constantinople and see Mahommedans
worshipping in St. Sophia; we go to Greece or Sicily and find
Christian worship in many of the old temples. Thus the
change of cult in Egypt, which I claim to have demonstrated
on astronomical grounds at Denderah, is a thing with which we
are perfectly familiar nowadays. The great point, however, is
that in Egypt the change of cult might depend upon astronomical
change&mdash;upon the precession of the equinoxes, as well
as upon different schools of religious or astronomical thought.
We gather from this an idea of the wonderfully continuous
observations which were made by the Egyptians of the
risings and settings of stars, because, if the work had not
been absolutely continuous, they would certainly never have
got the very sharp idea of the facts of precession which they
undoubtedly possessed; and it is also, I think, pretty clear
that future astronomical study will enable us to write the
history of those changes which are now hidden by that tremendous
mythological difficulty, which has not yet been faced.
That, of course, is not the only difficulty, because the question
is clouded by the absence of authentic dates and the perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301"> 301</span>
reference to the past which is met with in all the monuments.
The Egyptians were much more anxious to bring back to
knowledge what happened 1000 years before than to give an
idea of the current history of the country.</p>

<p>We have, then, at length arrived at a possible explanation
of the difficulties acknowledged in regard to the temples of
Denderah in Chapters XIX. and XX.</p>

<p>It is, briefly, that at some epoch observations of the star
Sirius replaced, or were added to, those made of γ Draconis.
Mythologically, a new Isis would be born.</p>

<p>This point will be referred to later; one of the longest-lasting
astro-theological strifes in Egypt was the fight for
supremacy between the priests of Amen and the priests of Set.
At Denderah the former were ultimately victorious, and hence
the change of cult.</p>

<p>This suggestion is based on the following considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) While the Denderah Hathor was represented by the
disk and horns on a hippopotamus, at Thebes (the city of the
"Bull" Amen) Hathor is represented by a cow with a like
head-dress.</p>

<p>(2) Isis, represented originally as a goddess with the two
feathers of Amen, standing in a boat, is now changed to a cow
with the disk and horns.</p>

<p>(3) Hathor was the "cow of the western hills" of Thebes.
It is in these hills that the temple Dêr el-Bahari lies; and this
temple, if oriented originally to Sirius, would have been founded
about 8000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Sirius at rising would have an amplitude
of 20° S. of E.</p>

<p>(4) A temple was built or restored later at Denderah,
and Sirius with the cow's horns and disk became the great
goddess there; and when her supremacy all over Egypt became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302"> 302</span>
undoubted, her birthplace was declared&mdash;at Denderah&mdash;to have
been Denderah.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>(5) In the month-list at the Ramesseum the first month
is dedicated to Sirius, the third to Hathor. This is not, however,
a final argument, because <i>local</i> cults may have been in
question.</p>

<p>(6) "Set" seems to have been a generic name applied to the
northern (? circumpolar) constellations, perhaps because <i>Set</i> =
darkness, and these stars, being <i>always visible</i> in the night, may
have in time typified it. Taurt, the hippopotamus, was the
wife of Set. The Thigh was the thigh of Set, etc. γ Draconis
was associated therefore with Set, and the symbolism for Set-Hathor
was the hippopotamus with horns and disk. Now
if, as is suggested, Sirius replaced γ Draconis, and the cow
replaced the hippopotamus, the cult of Set might be expected
to have declined; and as a matter of fact the decline of the
worship of Set, which was generally paramount under the
earlier dynasties, and even the obliteration of the emblems on
the monuments, are among the best-marked cases of the kind
found in the inscriptions.</p>

<p>(7) The <i>Isis</i> temple of Denderah was certainly oriented to
Sirius; the <i>Hathor</i> temple was as certainly <i>not</i> so oriented.
And yet, in the restorations in later times (say, Thothmes III.&mdash;Ptolemies),
the cult has been made Sirian, and the references
are to the star which rises at the rising of the Nile.</p>

<p>So far, then, mythology is with me; but there is a
difficulty. According to the orientation theory, the cult must
follow the star; this must be held to as far as possible. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303"> 303</span>
suppose the processional movement causes the initial function
of a star to become inoperative, must not the cult&mdash;which, as
we assume, had chiefly to do with the heralding of sunrise
at one time of the year or other&mdash;change? And if the same
cult is conducted in connection with another star, will not
the old name probably be retained?</p>

<p>I do not see why the Egyptians should have hesitated to
continue the same cult under a different star when they
apparently quite naturally changed Orion from a form of
Osiris (Sah-Osiris) and a mummy (as he was represented when
the light of his stars was quenched at dawn at the rising
of Sirius) to that of Sah-Horus (when in later times the
constellation itself rose heliacally).</p>

<p>And, moreover, the antagonism of rival priesthoods has to
be considered. It is extremely probable that the change
of a Set temple at Denderah into a Theban Hathor-temple was
only one example of a system generally adopted, at least in
later times.</p>

<small>THE TEMPLE-STARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>The two preceding chapters should have suggested that if there
be any truth in the astronomical and mythological views therein
put forth, there should be other stars to deal with besides Sirius
and γ Draconis, and other temples besides those at Annu, Denderah
and Thebes which have to be studied.</p>

<p>This is so, and I now propose to give a general account of
the conclusions so far arrived at, but I must <i>in limine</i> state that
the account must be a brief one and more suggestive than
final, for the reason that the lack of accurate local data stops
the way.</p>

<p>In an inquiry of this kind it is well to work slowly out
from the known. The facts which have been given will, I
think, cause it to be generally agreed that in the temple of
Isis at Denderah we have a structure which the inscriptions,
as well as astronomical inquiry, show was certainly a temple
oriented to Sirius. The other fact that New Year's Day in
the Nile valley was determined for thousands of years by
the heliacal rising of that star, is among the most familiar
in the domain of Egyptology.</p>

<p>Obviously, then, the first inquiry must refer to the possible
existence of other Sirian temples.</p>

<p>From 3285 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Sirius rose heliacally at the solstice,
its declination has varied from 24° S. to 16½° S. in 500 B.C.
The corresponding amplitudes for Thebes being 26½° and
18° S. of E.</p>

<p>Between these amplitudes we find the following temples:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is quite clear that we must not look for Sirian temples
before 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, because the heliacal rising of Sirius at
Thebes before that time did not take place near the solstice.
The above table shows that the earliest Sirian temple really
dates from about 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>But what star did Sirius replace? An inspection of a precessional
globe shows at once that the star which rose heliacally
at the solstice before Sirius was α Columbæ (Phact). Its
declination has varied from 57° S. at 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 37° S. at 0.</p>

<p>We have the following temples which might have been
oriented to this star; and here I must repeat that once a star
has been symbolised as a god or a goddess on account of its
astronomical utility, the cult would be continued after the
utility had ceased&mdash;that is, in this case, after Sirius had
replaced Phact astronomically.</p>

<p>The temple of Hathor at Abu Simbel, embellished by
Rameses II., was in all probability a shrine dedicated to Amen-t-Hathor
about 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Amen-t seems to have been an
Ethiopian goddess, for we hear nothing of her at Heliopolis or
Memphis.</p>

<p>It follows that if this be so, Sirius succeeded to α Columbæ
precisely as γ Draconis succeeded to Dubhe; but temples could
still be dedicated to the old Hathor α Columbæ, while this was
not possible for Dubhe, because it became circumpolar and
never rose.</p>

<p>It may also be pointed out that the temple V of Lepsius at
Karnak finds its place in a series by supposing it to have been
oriented to the S.E. instead of the N.W. as shown in Lepsius'
maps. Such a mistake might easily have arisen in consequence
of its ruined condition. It may be stated in favour of my view
that I am acquainted with no temple in Egypt directed
between the amplitudes 35° and 90° N. of W.</p>

<p>But so far we have dealt only with the summer solstice,
and yet in Egypt there were people who lived in towns with
E. and W. walls who, I take it, must have had a worship
depending upon the equinoxes.</p>

<p>About 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Antares (α Scorpii) rose heliacally at the
autumnal equinox as α Columbæ did, as we have seen, at the
summer solstice. There is not much doubt, from the symbol of
Serk-t that this goddess represented a star in the Scorpion.
Further, at that date its rising took place due east, so any E.
and W. temple&mdash;and many existed in <i>Lower</i> Egypt&mdash;might
have been then used for observations of this star.</p>

<p>But about the same time the southern star, α Centauri, could
have been used to herald the sunrise at the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>It would appear that several temples were directed to this
star in <i>Upper</i> Egypt from 3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onward. The series of
them is shown in the preceding table.</p>

<p>For the vernal equinox, so far, I have found no temples
besides those directed due E. in which the rising of the Pleiades
may have been watched. It is more than probable that the
worship of the sacred bull by the Memphitic inhabitants of
Egypt may have been connected with this constellation.
Certainly in pyramid times Neith and Serk-t were both worshipped,
and the goddesses under whose protection the Canopic
vases were supposed to be&mdash;Isis, Nephthys, Neith, and Serk-t&mdash;may
have symbolised the two solstices and the two equinoxes.</p>

<p>We may next consider the complete series of N.E. temples
represented at Heliopolis, Denderah and Thebes. These we
must, as I have shown in Chapter XX., divide into two
series, dealing with α Ursæ Majoris before it became circumpolar,
and γ Draconis afterwards.</p>

<p>I have already (p. 208) stated that α Lyræ may possibly
have preceded both α Ursæ Majoris and γ Draconis as a
representative of Set, but no table is necessary.</p>

<p>The table brings before us the remarkable fact that at
Redesieh and Denderah, which both lie on the two old roads
from the Red Sea into Upper Egypt, we have the first traces
of the worship of Set: in other words, of observations during
the night in that region, as we found it at Annu.</p>

<p>As α Ursæ Majoris and γ Draconis were observed in the extreme
north, so several stars appear to have been observed near
the south point, among them Canopus (α Argûs), towards which
star the temples shown in the following table seem to have
been directed, among them the well-known temple of Khons at
Karnak, so that provisionally we may take that divinity as a
personification of the star. Granting this, it will be noted
that the introduction of this cult into Thebes was late; this is
quite in harmony with the statements of Egyptologists, who
point out that this god has the side-lock, indicating youth, and
that he was the latest addition to the Theban Triad.</p>

<p>In later times the curve of declination of this star is so flat
that most accurate measures are required.</p>

<p>When we attempt to trace the <i>most</i> southerly stars to which
temples were erected in Upper Egypt, we find a series of
temples which are very remarkable in several respects from the
orientation point of view. Their amplitudes are all above 74°,
one being as high as 86½.° They all face South of <i>West</i>, and
when their latitudes are taken into account, the very striking
thing comes out that the declination of the star observed was
very nearly the same&mdash;that is, that probably <i>all the temples were
founded at about the same time to observe the same star</i>.</p>

<p>The facts are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>With regard to the Philæ temple, the amplitude is uncertain,
as the measures do not agree; but if we reject Philæ the other
coincidences are too remarkable to be neglected.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that a complete survey of the island will
soon be undertaken.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot find any important stars to fit this declination
since 7000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> except Canopus and Phact, and the latter is
barred because it was used as a <i>rising star</i>, and indeed was the
first solstitial Isis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312"> 312</span></p>

<p>If we inquire into the conditions relative to Canopus, we
find that star had the declination of 64° about 6400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and
that, as determined by the processional globe, it then set
heliacally at the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>If we assume that Canopus is in question, the break between
the dates 6400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 2150 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> has to be explained. There
may have been temples at Thebes now destroyed. There
seems no doubt that the temple at Philæ, lettered Y by the
French and L in Baedeker's Handbook, was the most ancient
one on the island, and that the cult was similar to that at
Edfû.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>It will be most interesting to see whether the suggestion
that Canopus was observed in early times at Philæ and Edfû
especially, be confirmed.</p>

<p>It is clear that for these and other southern temples an
examination of the local conditions and a determination
of the places of the southern stars are necessary before the
other southern gods and goddesses can be worked out.</p>

<p>We next come to the N.W. quadrant. Here, apparently,
we have only to deal with Capella and Spica. Summarising
the information detailed in a previous chapter, we find the
following temples probably erected to these stars:&mdash;</p>

suggest that the various temples were originally founded.</p>

<p>To prepare this table I have used the precessional globe
previously referred to. The results are therefore rough, as
the ecliptic has been taken as fixed; but they are useful for
the purpose of a reconnaissance. The table shows the stars
on the horizon, or near it, at the equinoxes and solstices when
the sun was 10° below the horizon. When the star was not
exactly on the horizon when the sun was 10° below, its position
above or below at that moment is indicated in the table by
giving the number of degrees the star was above (+) the
horizon or below it (-) at the time.</p>

<p>The dates taken are those most conveniently given by
the globe, being those in fact occupied by the pole of the
equator at some one or other of twenty-four equidistant
points on a circle round the pole of the ecliptic starting
from 1880 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> as zero.</p>

<p>It will be seen that all the stars referred to in the preceding
tables occupied positions of great importance between
6000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 2500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and that there are several southern
stars indicated which eventually may be useful in the
discussion of the southern temples.</p>

<small>THE HISTORY OF SUN-WORSHIP AT ANNU AND THEBES.</small></h2></div>


<p>Now that we have been able to discuss with more or less
fulness the stars&mdash;very few in number&mdash;to which the temples
in both Upper and Lower Egypt were probably oriented, and
further, the astronomical requirements which they were intended
to fulfil, we are in a position to consider several questions
of great interest in relation to the earliest observations
of the sun and stars.</p>

<p>One of the first among these questions is whether the
complete inquiry throws any light upon the suggestion made
on page 85, that in different temples we seem to be dealing
with at least two different kinds of astronomical thought and
methods; as if, indeed, we were in presence of ideas so
differently based that the assumption of different races of men,
rather than different astronomical and religious ideas, is almost
necessary to account for them.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the apparent result of the inquiry into
sun-worship as practised at Annu and Thebes.</p>

<p>It was suggested that, although in the matter of simple
worship the sun would come before the stars, in <i>temple</i>-worship
the conditions would be reversed in consequence of the stable
rising-and setting-places of the latter as compared with those
of the sun at different times of the year.</p>

<p>Another suggestion was hazarded that sun temple-worship
might have been an accidental result of the sunlight entering a
temple which had really been built to observe a star; and that
such temple sun-worship might possibly have preceded the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316"> 316</span>
at which the solstices and equinoxes, and their importance, had
been made out. I think it is possible to show that this really
happened, and we owe the demonstration of this important fact
to the Egyptian habit of having two associated temples at right
angles to each other, because this habit justifies the assumption
that at Annu the mounds and single obelisk which now remain
not only indicate the certain existence in former times of one
temple, but, in all probability, of two at right angles to each
other.</p>

<p>The next question we have to consider is whether the
researches at Annu bear this surmise out. Let me refer to
what has already been stated. As I have shown in Chapter
VIII. (p. 77), the north and south faces bear 13° north of west&mdash;13°
south of east. I have elsewhere shown (Chap. XXI.,
p. 215) that there is good reason for believing that the original
foundation of the temple at Annu dates from the time when
the north-pointing member of such a double system was
directed to α Ursæ Majoris. This was somewhat earlier than
5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Bearing in mind the facts obtained with regard to other
similar rectangular systems, we are led to inquire whether at
that date a temple oriented to declination 11° north, that is the
declination proper to the amplitude of the member looking
west, was directed to any star.</p>

<p>We find that the important star Capella was in question.</p>

<p>Now, so far in my references to stars, little mention has been
made of Capella. It is obvious that the first thing to be done
on the orientation hypothesis is to see whether any other
temple&mdash;and if of known cult, so much the better&mdash;is found
oriented to Capella. There is one such temple; it was erected
by Thothmes III. (Time of Thothmes, 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Amplitude
of temple, 35° west of north = with hills 3° high, 32½°<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317"> 317</span>
north declination; Capella 33° north declination about
1700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) It is the temple of <i>Ptah</i> at Karnak.</p>

<p>And now it appears there is another. During the year 1892
the officers of the Museum of Gîzeh, under the direction of
M. de Morgan, excavated a temple at Memphis to the north of
the hut containing the recumbent statue of Rameses, and during
their work they found two magnificent statues of Ptah, "les
plus remarquables statues divines qu'on ait encore trouvées en
Égypte,"<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and a colossal model in rose granite of the sacred
boat of Ptah.</p>

<p>These discoveries have led the officers in question to the
conclusion that the building among the ruins of which these
priceless treasures have been found is veritably the world-renowned
temple of Ptah of Memphis. It may, therefore, be
accepted as such for the purpose of the present inquiry,
although it is difficult to reconcile its <i>emplacement</i> in relation to
the statues with the accounts given by the Arab historians.</p>

<p>In January, 1893, Captain Lyons, R.E., was good enough
to accompany me to determine the orientation of the newly
uncovered temple walls. We had already, two years previously,
carefully measured the bearings of the statues of Rameses.
We found the temple in all probability facing westwards, and
not eastwards; this we determined by a seated statue facing
westwards; and we concluded its orientation, assuming a
magnetic variation of 4½° west, to be 12¾° north of west, and
the hills in front of it, assuming the village of Mît-Rahîneh
non-existent, to be 50′ high.</p>

<p>Here, then, we get reproduced almost absolutely the conditions
of the obelisk at Heliopolis in a Ptah temple oriented
to Capella 5200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We are driven, then, to the conclusion that the star Capella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318"> 318</span>
is personified by <i>Ptah</i>, and that as Capella was worshipped
setting, Ptah is represented as a mummy. If this be so, we
must also accept another conclusion: the temples both at
Annu and Memphis were dedicated to Ptah.</p>

<p>About 5300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we seem almost in the time of the divine
dynasties, and begin to understand how it is that in the old
traditions Ptah precedes Rā and is called "the father of the
beginnings, and the creator of the egg of the Sun and Moon."<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We are driven to the conclusion that this worship at Annu
and Memphis was the worship of the sun's disc when setting,
at the time of the year heralded by Capella, when it had the
declination of 10° north. The dates on which the sun had
this declination were, as already stated, about April 18 and
August 24 of our Gregorian year. The former, in Egypt,
dominated by the Nile, was about the time of the associated
spring and harvest festivals.</p>

<p>So much for the Ptah mummy form of the Sun-God, to
which the <i>Theban</i> priests erected no important temples.
There was still another mummy form of the Sun-God, the
worship of which existed at Thebes, but which they did
their best to abolish by the intensification of the worship of
Amen-Rā.</p>

<p>At Thebes, as we have seen, the temple of Mut is associated
with one at right angles to it, facing north-west. The
amplitudes are 72½° north of east and 17½° north of west.
I have shown that the temple of Mut would allow γ Draconis
to be seen along its axis about 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> <i>I now state that</i>
Spica <i>would be seen along the axis of the rectangular temple at
the same time</i>.</p>

<p>The cult in this temple-system there can be no doubt, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319"> 319</span>
think, was the worship of Min, otherwise read Amsu, or Khem
in ithyphallic mummy form. This was associated possibly with
a harvest-home festival on May 1. (Amplitude of temple, 17½°
north of west = declination 15° = sun's N. declination on
May 1.)</p>

<p>Both at Annu and Thebes, therefore, before the temple of
Amen-Rā at the latter place became of importance, the sun
was worshipped in a temple pointed neither to a solstice nor
to an equinox.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the suggestion that <i>possibly</i> sun-worship
existed before any great development of the solstitial solar
worship is amply justified.</p>

<p>We have next to consider what had taken place at Thebes,
so far as we can trace it on the orientation hypothesis after
3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when apparently the Spica temple and the associated
Mut temple were founded.</p>

<p>To do this it is important to study the masterly essay by
M. Virey, entitled "Notices Générales," on the discoveries
made at Dêr el-Bahari by MM. Maspero and Grébaut, which
is to be found in the new edition of the Gîzeh Catalogue.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
M. Virey makes us acquainted with the politics of the Theban
priests, or rather of the confraternity of Amen which they
had founded.</p>

<p>From his account of the confraternity and of the various
attempts made by it to acquire political power, however,
we gather that it was not only intended to intensify the
cult of Amen-Rā at the expense of the sun-worship previously
existing at Thebes (in the Spica temple), but that one of the
chief aims of the confraternity of Amen was to abolish the
worship of Set, Sit, Sut, or Sutech; that is, as I think I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320"> 320</span>
proved, generically, the stars near the North Pole, and, as it
can be shown, in favour of the southern ones.</p>

<p>The temple of Mut was the chief temple at Karnak in
which the cult of the northern stars was carried on, and this
was associated with the Spica temple; so both these temples
had to go.</p>

<p>We can now realise what the Theban priests got Thothmes
to do. They were strong measures, since in his day the cult
of Spica (the solar disc, Aten, Min, Khem), and γ Draconis
(the Hippopotamus-and-Lion Isis) was supreme.</p>

<p>The little shrine of the Theban Amen was enlarged and
built right across the fair-way of the temple of Mut, so that
the worship was as effectively stopped as the worship of Isis
(when it was prohibited by law) was stopped at Pompeii by
the town authorities bricking up the window by which the star
was observed.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Further, the shrine so restored was to be of such magnificence
that the Spica temple, which had hitherto held first
rank, became an insignificant chapel in comparison. Nor
was this all: in order still to emphasise the supremacy of
Amen-Rā, a third-rate temple was erected to Ptah.</p>

<p>It is clear from this that we must date the great supremacy
of the cult of Amen-Rā in and after the time of Thothmes III.,
and that the cult superseded at Thebes was largely based upon
the old worship at Annu.</p>

<p>Now, one of the most remarkable events in Egyptian
history was the so-called apostasy of Amen-hetep IV., some
hundred and fifty years after Thothmes III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321"> 321</span></p>

<p>In the time of Thothmes III. the alliance between the royal
and the sacerdotal power was of the closest, and in no time
of the world's history have priests been more richly endowed
than were then the priests of Amen. Not content, however,
with their sacred functions, they aimed at political power so
obviously that Thothmes IV. and Amen-hetep III., to check
their intentions, favoured the cults and priesthoods of Annu and
other cities of the north. Amen-hetep III. and his son, Amen-hetep
IV., also looked for alliances out of Egypt altogether, and
entered into diplomatic relations with the princes of Asia,
including even the king of Babylon. This brought him and
the priests to open warfare. He replied to their anger by
proscribing the cult of Amen, and the name of Amen was effaced
from the monuments; still the priestly party was strong enough
to make it unpleasant for the king in Thebes; and, to deal them
yet another blow, he quitted that city and settled at Tell
el-Amarna, at the same time, according to the statement of
M. Virey, reviving an old Heliopolitan cult. He took for
divine protection the solar disk <i>Aten</i>, "which was one of the
most ancient forms of one of the most ancient gods of Egypt,
Rā of Heliopolis."<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Now let us say that the time of Amen-hetep
IV., according to the received authorities, was about
1450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The lines of the "Temple of the Sun" at Tell
el-Amarna are to be gathered from Lepsius' map, reproduced
in the illustration on the next page. The orientation is 13° north
of west.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This gives us a declination of 11° north, and the star
Spica at its setting would be visible in the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322"> 322</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_p322" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="allsmcap">THE TEMPLES AT TELL EL-AMARNA.</span>
<span class="allsmcap">A</span>, The Aten (Spica) Temple; <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, the Set Temple.</div>
</div>

<p>Still the light would not enter it <i>axially</i> if the orientation
is correct. This would have happened in 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that is,
600 years before the time of Amen-hetep IV. This is a point
which Egyptologists must discuss; it is quite certain that
such a pair of temples as those of which Lepsius gives us the
plans could not have been completely built in his short reign,
and they would not perhaps have been commenced on <i>heretical</i>
lines in any previous reign during the Eighteenth dynasty.
They must therefore have been commenced before 1700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323"> 323</span>
perhaps in the Seventeenth dynasty. In any case they were
certainly finished by Khu-en-Aten.</p>

<p>Professor Flinders Petrie has been good enough, in reply
to an inquiry, to state his opinion that the temple was entirely
built by Khu-en-Aten. Should this be confirmed, it may have
been oriented directly to the sun, on the day named, or was
probably built parallel to some former temple, for traces of
other temples are shown on Lepsius' plan, and I presume
Khu-en-Aten is not supposed to have built all of them.</p>

<p>What, then, was this worship which had been absent from
Thebes, but which had held its own to the north to such an
extent that Amen-hetep IV. went back to it so eagerly? It
could not have been the worship of Capella as a star alone,
for such worship had been provided for by Thothmes III. by
building temple G. Nor could it have been the worship of
Spica as a star alone, for in that case the precedent of Annu
would not have been appealed to.</p>

<p>The worship he emphasised there exactly resembled that
which had in early times been paramount at Heliopolis. One
based on it, but not identical with it, had been in vogue at
Thebes from 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to the time of Thothmes III., who, as
the tool of the confraternity of Amen, intensified the solstitial
worship, and did his best to kill that which had been based
upon the Heliopolis cult.</p>

<p>I say <i>exactly resembled</i>, because Amen-hetep IV., or some
one of the preceding kings of Egypt, when reintroducing the
old worship at Tell el-Amarna, orients the solar temple 13°
north of west according to the data available. Now when
we take the difference of latitude between Heliopolis and
Tell el-Amarna into account, we find that the same declination
(within half a degree) is obtained from both.</p>

<p>Hence, at Annu in the old days, and at Tell el-Amarna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324"> 324</span>
afterwards, the sun was worshipped on the same day of the
year. At both places the sunlight at sunset would enter the
temple on April 18 and August 24 of the Gregorian year; hence
both temples were probably built really to observe the sunset
on a special day. In this view how appropriate was the
prayer of Aāhmes, Khu-en-Aten's chief official&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Beautiful is thy setting, thou sun's disk of life, thou Lord of Lords and
King of the worlds. When thou unitest thyself with the heaven at thy setting,
mortals rejoice before thy countenance and give honour to him who has created
them, and pray before him who has formed them, before the glance of thy son
who loves thee the King Khu-en-aten. The whole land of Egypt and all peoples
repeat all thy names at thy rising, to magnify thy rising in like manner as
thy setting."<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
</div>

<p>As may be gathered from Lepsius' maps and plans, this
"temple of the Sun" was not built alone. Set was again
brought to the front. There was another at right angles to
it, and while Spica was seen setting in one, a star near
γ Draconis was rising in the other.</p>

<p>It may be added that it was not apparently till Rameses II.
built his temple M that Set again had an available temple
at Karnak: one, however, again to be blocked when the
victorious Tirhaqa and the Theban priests returned after
their exile. (See page <a href="#Page_186">186</a>.)</p>

<p>We see, then, that in a detailed study of the sun-worship
at Thebes alone, we distinctly trace two schools of astronomical
thought associated with different religious tendencies. As a
protest against the Southern worship of the Theban priests,
Khu-en-Aten goes back to a Northern cult. This point is
evidently worth further inquiry.</p>

<small>THE EARLY TEMPLE AND GREAT PYRAMID BUILDERS.</small></h2></div>


<p>In previous chapters I have referred to the difference in
astronomical thought evidenced by the solstitial solar worship
at Thebes as opposed to the non-solstitial solar worship
at Annu, and again by the observations of southern stars
above Thebes as opposed to observations of high northern
stars below.</p>

<p>There is still another fundamental difference to be
signalised, and that is the building in some cases of
pyramids, with or without associated temples, east and
west true.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be generally conceded that the differences
in thought indicated by the building or non-building of
colossal pyramids are greater than those indicated by the
two other <i>differentia</i> to which I have referred, and on this
ground I propose to enter upon this point at some length.</p>

<p>We may first inquire if there be any other class of considerations
which can be utilised to continue the discussion
of the question thus raised on astronomical grounds. It is
obvious that if sufficient tradition exists to permit us to
associate the different classes of structures which have been
studied astronomically with definite periods of Egyptian
history, a study of the larger outlines of that history will
enable us to determine whether or not the critical changes in
dynasties and rulers were or were not associated with critical
changes in astronomical ideas as revealed by changes in
temple-worship and pyramid building. If there be no
connection the changes may have been due to a change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326"> 326</span>
idea only&mdash;a variation in astronomical thought&mdash;and the
suggestion of a distinction of race falls to the ground.</p>

<p>In a region of inquiry where the facts are so few and
difficult to recognise among a mass of myths and traditions,
to say nothing of contradictory assertions by different
authors in their exposition of the inscriptions, the more
closely we adhere to a rigidly scientific method of inquiry
the better. I propose to show, therefore, that there is one
working hypothesis which seems to include a great many
of the facts, and I hope to give the hypothesis and the
facts in such a way that if there be anything inaccurately
or incompletely stated it will be easy at once to change
the front of the inquiry and proceed along the new line
indicated.</p>

<p>I may begin by remarking that it is fundamental for
the hypothesis, that the temple of Annu or Heliopolis existed,
as stated by Maspero and other high authorities, before the
times of Mini (Mena) and the pyramid builders.</p>

<p>Before Mini, according to Maspero, "On et les villes du
Nord avaient eu la part principale dans le développement
de la civilisation Égyptienne. Les prières et les hymnes,
qui formèrent plus tard le noyau des livres sacrés, avaient
été rédigés à An."</p>

<p>My observations of the orientation of the obelisk at
Annu show that the temple of which it formed part may
have possibly been an early member of the series which
includes the temple of Mut at Thebes, and of Hathor at
Denderah; that is, the worship of Set was in question, to
speak generically. Now, according to Maspero, Sit or Set
formed one of the divine dynasties, being associated with
the sun and air gods at Annu, <i>i.e.</i> with Rā, Atmu, Osiris,
Horus, and Shou.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327"> 327</span></p>

<p>It is also certain that the solar temple at Annu at right-angles
to the Sit temple, was pointed north-west, and
probably to Capella setting, about 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>So much for the astronomical antiquity of Annu. But
there are other northern towns besides Annu for which a
very high antiquity is claimed.</p>

<p>On this point here is the opinion of Ebers and Dümichen,
two of our highest authorities: "Dies ist die älteste Stadt in
Aegypten, und das mit ihm verbundene Abydos kann nicht
viel junger gewesen sein, denn schon im alten Reiche wird es
vielfach als heilige Stadt erwähnt."<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The sacred character of Abydos is also pointed out by
Maspero.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>"C'est comme ville sainte qu'elle était universellement
connue. Ses sanctuaires étaient célèbres, son dieu Osiris
vénéré, ses fêtes suivies par toute l'Égypte; les gens riches
des autres nomes tenaient à honneur de se faire dresser une
stèle dans son temple."</p>

<p>If it be found that the references to "ancestors," and
"divine ancestors," occur after the eleventh dynasty, the race
represented by Annu, or the one which immediately followed
it (? the Hor-Shesu) may be referred to (<i>see</i> the chapters on
the Egyptian year).</p>

<p>Of Abydos astronomically I can only say very little, as
the various statements as to the orientation of the north-east
temples there by various authors are so conflicting
that nothing certain can be made out. As they stand they
are suggestive that these temples may possibly be associated
with that at Luxor, and it may be gathered from the
description of them by Ebers and Dümichen in Baedeker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328"> 328</span>
that many references to Set (Anubis) occur in the inscriptions.
If subsequent measurements indicate that Abydos and Luxor
are to be treated together, then astronomically both these
places may represent a cult more ancient than that at Annu,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
since it would appear that in these cases α Lyræ was the
star personified by Anubis, as α Ursæ Majoris and γ Draconis
were subsequently. But if the cult were more ancient the
temple foundations were not, the first "length" of Luxor
having been built, on this supposition, about 4900 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The
last length built by Ramses II. was certainly oriented to
α Lyræ, by which I mean that if the building date given by
Egyptologists is correct, α Lyræ rose in the axis prolonged&mdash;another
instance of the long persistence of a cult, and of the
fact that the temples that we see are but shrines restored.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the above view is true for Luxor
and that Abydos followed suit, as is suggested by the imperfect
orientations, we are led to the conclusion that, taking existing
temple foundations, Annu preceded Abydos.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The astronomical results, then, are certainly in harmony
with the historical statement, which I take as fundamental,
that Annu preceded Memphis and pyramid times.</p>

<p>These times were not only remarkable on account of the
building of the great pyramids; there was a vast change in
the cult.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that at Annu we seemed limited
to Set as a stellar divinity; so soon as pyramid times are
reached, however, this is changed. The number of gods is
increased, and there is apparently a mixture, as if some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329"> 329</span>
influence had been at work besides that represented by Annu
and the pyramid builders.</p>

<p>I have given before the list of the gods of Heliopolis,
and have shown that with the exception of Sit none are
stellar. But we find in pyramid times the list is increased;
only the sun gods Rā, Horus, Osiris, are common to the two.
As new divinities we have<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Isis.</li>
<li>Hathor.</li>
<li>Nephthys.</li>
<li>Ptah.</li>
<li>Serk-t.</li>
<li>Sokhit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these the first two and the last two undoubtedly
symbolised stars, and there can be no question that the
temples of Isis built at the pyramids, Bubastis, Tanis and
elsewhere, were built to watch the rising of some of them.</p>

<p>The temple of Saïs, as I have said, had east and west
walls, and so had Memphis, according to Lepsius. The form
of Isis at Saïs was the goddess Nit, which, according to
some authorities, was the precursor of Athene. The temple
of Athene at Athens was oriented to the Pleiades.</p>

<p>There is also no question that the goddess Serk-t symbolised
Antares.</p>

<p>We find ourselves, then, in the presence of the worship of
the sun and stars in the ecliptic constellations in Egypt
during pyramid times, and in constellations connected with
the Equinox; for if we are right about the Pleiades and
Antares, these are the stars which heralded the sunrise at
the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox respectively, when the
sun was in Taurus and Scorpio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330"> 330</span></p>

<p>Now, associated with the introduction of these new
worships in pyramid times was the worship of the bull
Apis, this worship preceding the building of pyramids.
Mena is credited by some authors with its introduction,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> but
at any rate Kakau of the second dynasty issued proclamations
regarding it,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and a statue of Hapi was in the temple
of Cheops.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ground being thus cleared, I now state the working
hypothesis to which I have referred above.</p>

<p>1. The first civilisation as yet glimpsed, so far as
temple building goes, in <i>Northern</i> Egypt, represented by
that at Annu or Heliopolis, was a civilisation with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331"> 331</span>
non-equinoctial solar worship, combined with the cult of
a northern star.</p>

<div class="figright illowp40" id="i_p331" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p331.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">MNEVIS.</div>
</div>

<p>2. Memphis (possibly also Saïs, Bubastis, Tanis and
other cities with east and west walls) and the great
pyramids were built by a new invading
race, representing an advance in
astronomical thought. The northern
stars were worshipped possibly on the
meridian, and a star rising in the east
was worshipped at each equinox.</p>

<p>3. The subsequent blank in Egyptian
history was associated with conflicts
between these and other races,
which were ended by the victory of
the representatives of the old worship
of Annu, reinforced from the south,
as if north-star and south-star cults
had combined against the equinoctial
cult.</p>

<p>After these conflicts, east and west
pyramid building practically ceased,
Memphis takes second place, and
Thebes, a southern Annu, so far as the form of solar worship
and the cult of Sit are concerned, comes upon the scene as
the seat of the twelfth dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>4. The subsequent historical events were largely due
to conflicts with intruding races from the north-east. The
intruders established themselves in cities with east and
west walls, and were on each occasion driven out by
solstitial solar worshippers who founded dynasties (eighteenth
and twenty-fifth) at Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332"> 332</span></p>

  <div class="caption">THE TWO GREAT PYRAMIDS AT THE TIME OF THE INUNDATION.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333"> 333</span></p>

<p>Some detailed remarks are necessary on several points
connected with the above generalisation. I will take them
<i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>We find at Memphis, Saïs, Bubastis, and Tanis, east and
west walls which at once stamp those cities as differing in
origin from Annu, Abydos and Thebes, where, as I have
shown, the walls trend either north-west&mdash;south-east or north-east&mdash;south-west.</p>

<p>For Memphis, Saïs and Tanis the evidence is afforded
by the maps of Lepsius. For Bubastis it depends upon the
statement of Naville, that the walls run "nearly from east
to west," and with the looseness too often associated with
such statements, it is not said whether this bearing is true
or magnetic.</p>

<p>Associated with these east and west walls there is, moreover,
evidence of great antiquity. Bubastis, according to Naville,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
has afforded traces of the date of Cheops and Chephren,
and it is stated by Manetho to have existed as early as the
second dynasty.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that the pyramids
in Egypt are generally oriented east and west.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Nor is this
all; there has been a distinct evolution in their method of
structure.</p>

<p>One of the oldest, if not the oldest pyramid known is the
so-called "step-pyramid of Sakkarah." The steps are six in
number, and vary in height from thirty-eight to twenty-nine
feet, their width being about six feet. The dimensions are
(352 north and south) × (390 east and west) × 197 feet. Some
authorities think this pyramid was erected in the first dynasty
by the fourth king (Nenephes of Manetho, Ata of the tablet
of Abydos). The arrangement of chambers in this pyramid
is quite special.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334"> 334</span></p>

  <div class="caption">THE STEP-PYRAMID OF SAKKARAH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335"> 335</span></p>

<p>The claim to the highest antiquity of the step-pyramid
is disputed by some in favour of the "false pyramid" of
Mêdûm. It also is a genuine step-pyramid, 115 feet high;
its outline, which conceals some of the steps, shows three
stages, seventy, twenty, and twenty-five feet high; but
in its internal structure it is really a step-pyramid of six
stages.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p335" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p335.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE PYRAMID OF MÊDÛM.</div>
</div>

<p>This pyramid must, according to the important and
conclusive researches of Professor Flinders Petrie,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> be
attributed to Seneferu, although De Rougé had furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336"> 336</span>
evidence to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Seneferu was a king of the
fourth dynasty.</p>

<p>We have at Dashûr the only remaining abnormal pyramid,
called the blunted pyramid, for the reason that the inclination
changes at about one-third of the height. This pyramid
forms one of a group of four, two of stone, and, be it carefully
borne in mind, two of brick; their dimensions are 700 × 700
× 326 feet; 620 × 620 × 321 feet; 350 × 350 × 90 feet;
and 343 × 343 × 156 feet.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p336.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE "BLUNTED PYRAMID" OF DASHÛR.</div>
</div>

<p>One of these pyramids was formerly supposed to have
been built by Seneferu; if any of them had been erected by
King Usertsen III. of the twelfth dynasty, as was formerly
thought, the hypothesis we are considering would have been
invalid.</p>

<p>Only after Seneferu, then, do we come to the normal
Egyptian pyramid, the two largest at Gîzeh built by Cheops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337"> 337</span>
(Chufu) and Chephren (fourth dynasty) being, so far as is
accurately known, the oldest of the series. (According to
Mariette the date of Mena is 5004 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the fourth dynasty
commenced in 4235.)</p>

<p>Associated with the cities with east and west walls and
these pyramids are temples facing due east, fit, therefore, to
receive the rays from a star on the equator or of the morning
sun rising at an equinox.</p>

<p>According to Professor Flinders Petrie, at the pyramid of
Mêdûm there is a small temple open to the west on the east
side of the pyramid. At sunset at the equinox the sepulchral
chamber and the sun were in line from the adytum. The
priest faced a double Osiris.</p>

<p>Other pyramids were built at Sakkarah during the sixth
dynasty, but it is remarkable that such a king as Pepi-Meri-Rā
should not have imitated the majestic structures of the fourth
dynasty. He is said to have built a pyramid at Sakkarah,
but its obscurity is evidence that the pyramid idea was
giving way, and it looks as if this dynasty were really on
the side of the southern cult, for the authority of Memphis
declined, and Abydos was preferred, while abroad Sinai was
reconquered, and Ethiopia was kept in order.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The sphinx (oriented true east) may possibly be ascribed to
the earliest pyramid builders; it could only have been sculptured
by a race with an equinoctial cult.</p>


<h3><i>The Buildings of the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties.</i></h3>

<p>We have next to consider what happened after the great
gap in Egyptian history between the sixth and twelfth
dynasties, 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;2851 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (Mariette); from Nitocris to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338"> 338</span>
Amenemhāt I. We pass to the Middle Empire, and here we
have merely to deal with the worships previously referred to in
Northern Egypt.</p>

<p>Amenemhāt I. built no pyramids, he added no embellishments
to Memphis; but he took Annu under his care, and
now we first hear of Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Usertsen I. built no pyramids, he added no embellishments
to Memphis, but he also took Annu under his care,
and added obelisks to the temples, one of which remains to
this day. Further, he restored the temple of Osiris at Abydos,
and added to the temple of Amen-Rā at Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Surely it is very noteworthy that the first thing the
kings of the twelfth dynasty did was to look after the
only three temples in Egypt of which traces exist, which
I have shown to have been oriented to the Sun <i>not</i> at an
equinox. It is right, however, to remark that there seems to
have been a mild recrudescence of pyramid building towards
the end of the twelfth dynasty, and immediately preceding
the Hyksos period, whether as a precursor of that period
or not.</p>

<p>Usertsen's views about his last home have come down to
us in a writing by his scribe Mirri:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mon maître m'envoya en mission pour lui préparer une grande demeure
éternelle. Les couloirs et la chambre intérieure étaient en maçonnerie, et
renouvelaient les merveilles de construction des dieux. Il y eut en elle des
colonnes sculptées, belles comme le ciel, un bassin creusé qui communiquait
avec le Nil, des portes, des obélisques, une façade en pierre de Rouou."</p>
</div>

<p>There was nothing pyramidal about this idea, but one
hundred and fifty years later we find Amenemhāt III. returning
both to the gigantic irrigation works and the pyramid
building of the earlier dynasties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339"> 339</span></p>

<p>The scene of these labours was the Fayyûm, where, to
crown the new work, two ornamental pyramids were built,
surmounted by statues, and finally the king himself was buried
in a pyramid near the Labyrinth.</p>


<h3><i>The Buildings of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</i></h3>

<p>The blank in Egyptian history between the twelfth and
eighteenth dynasties is known to have been associated with
the intrusion of the so-called Hyksos. It is supposed these
made their way into Egypt from the countries in and to the
west of Mesopotamia; it is known that they settled in the
cities with east and west walls. They were finally driven
out by Aāhmes, the king of solstitial-solar Thebes, who began
the eighteenth dynasty.</p>

<p>On page 338 I have shown what happened after the first
great break in Egyptian history&mdash;a resuscitation of the solar
worship at Annu, Abydos and Thebes.</p>

<p>I have next to show that precisely the same thing happened
after the Hyksos period (Dyn. 13 (?) Mariette, 2233 Brugsch;
Dyn. 18, 1703 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Mariette, 1700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Brugsch) had disturbed
history for some five hundred years.</p>

<p>It is known from the papyrus Sellier (G.C. 257) that
Aāhmes, the first king of the eighteenth dynasty, who
re-established the independence of Egypt, was in reality
fighting the priests of Sutech in favour of the priests of
Amen-Rā, the solstitial-solar god, a modern representative
of Atmu of Annu.</p>

<p>Amen-Rā was the successor of Menthu. So close was
the new worship to the oldest at Annu, that at the highest
point of Theban power the third priest of Amen took the
same titles as the Grand Priest of Annu, "who was the head
of the first priesthood in Egypt." The "Grand Priest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340"> 340</span>
Annu," who was also called the "Great Observer of Rā and
Atmu," had the privilege of entering at all times into the
<i>Hahenben</i> or Naos. The priest Padouamen, whose mummy
was found in 1891, bore these among his other titles.</p>

<p>The assumption of the title was not only to associate the
Theban priesthood with their northern <i>confrères</i>, but surely to
proclaim that the old Annu worship was completely restored.</p>


<h3><i>The Buildings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.</i></h3>

<p>There was another invasion from Syria, which founded
the twenty-second dynasty, and again the government is
carried on in cities with east and west walls (Saïs, Tanis
and Bubastis). The solstitial-solar priests of Thebes withdraw
to Ethiopia. They return, however, in 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, drive
out the Syrian invaders, and, under Shabaka and Taharqa,
found a dynasty (the twenty-fifth) at Thebes, embellish the
temples there, and at Philæ, Medînet-Habû, and Denderah.</p>


<h3><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>We see, then, that every important change of cult was
associated either with invasions from without or with some
disturbance in Egypt itself, for in no other way can the gaps
in Egyptian history be explained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far we have considered the equinoctial temples as
opposed to the non-equinoctial ones in Northern Egypt. We
have next to go farther afield, and include the southern temple
worship and the possible influence of southern races even in
the very earliest times.</p>

<small>THE CULT OF NORTHERN AS OPPOSED TO SOUTHERN STARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>So far as my inquiries have yet gone, there is not above
Thebes, with the exceptions of Redesich and Dakkeh, any
temple resembling those at Annu, Thebes, Denderah and
Abydos, to which I have directed attention as having a high
north-east amplitude.</p>

<p>Similarly, with one or two exceptions which are probably
late, there are no temples facing the south-east below Thebes.</p>

<p>In short, in Lower Egypt the temples are pointed to
rising stars near the north point of the horizon or setting
north of west. In Upper Egypt we deal chiefly with temples
directed to stars rising in the south-east or setting low in
the south-west.</p>

<p>Here again we are in presence of as distinct differences
in astronomical thought and purpose of observation as we
found among those who directed temples to the sun at the
equinox, as opposed to those who worshipped that luminary
at some other time of the year.</p>

<p>Now with regard to the northern stars observed rising
in high amplitudes, we have found traces of their worship
in times so remote that in all probability at Annu and Denderah
α Ursæ Majoris was used before it became circumpolar.
We deal almost certainly with 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Since undoubtedly <i>new</i> temples with nearly similar
amplitudes (such as that denoted by M at Karnak) were
built in late times, we find so long a range of time indicated
that the utility of the stellar observations <i>from the
yearly point of view</i> could scarcely have been in question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342"> 342</span>
for the reason that the same star could not herald an
equinox or a solstice for four thousand years.</p>

<p>It may be suggested, therefore, that the observations
made in them had ultimately to do with the determination
of the hours of the night; this seems probable, for in Nubia
at present, time at night is thus told.</p>

<p>It may be that such stars as Canopus were used by the
southern peoples for the same purpose as α Ursæ Majoris
first and then γ Draconis were used by the northerners. In
other words, the question arises whether the extreme north
and south stars were not both used as warners of the
dawn all the year round, after the cult had been established
for use at some special time. Canopus, for instance, was of
use to herald the autumnal equinox, 6&mdash;5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; but it is
quite natural to suppose that its utility for night work at
all times of the year during which it was visible would
soon suggest itself, and the same remarks apply to the
Northern star γ Draconis.</p>

<p>It is well known that in quite early times means had
been found of dividing the day and night into twelve hours.
In the day shadows cast by the sun, or sundials, might have
been used, but how about the night?</p>

<p>We have seen that the Egyptians chiefly, if not exclusively,
observed a heavenly body and the position of
other bodies in relation to it, when it was rising or setting,
so that it was absolutely essential that the body which they
were to observe should rise and set. Everybody knows
that as seen in England there are many stars which neither
rise nor set. The latitude of London being 51°, the
elevation of the pole is 51°.</p>

<p>Hence, any star which lies within that distance from
the pole cannot set, but sweeps round without touching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343"> 343</span>
horizon at all. The latitude of Thebes being 25°, the
distance from the pole to the horizon is much smaller, and
so the number of stars which do not rise and set is much
smaller. The stars which do not rise or set are stars near
the pole, and therefore stars which move very slowly, and
the stars which rise most to the north and most to the
south are those bodies which are moving most slowly while
they yet rise or set. Can this slow rate of motion have had
anything to do with such stars being selected for observation,
the brightest star to the north most slowly moving,
the brightest star to the south most slowly moving? It is
possible that observations of these stars might have been
made in such a way that at the beginning of the evening
the particular position of γ Draconis, for instance, might
have been noted with regard to the pole-star; and seeing
that the Egyptians thoroughly knew the length of the night
and of the day in the different portions of the year, they
could at once&mdash;the moment they had the starting-point
afforded by the position of this star&mdash;practically use the circle
of the stars round the north pole as the dial of a sort of
celestial clock. May not this really have been the clock
with which they have been credited? However long or
short the night, the star which was at first above the pole-star,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
after it had got round so that it was on a level with
it, would have gone through a quarter of its revolution.</p>

<p>In low northern latitudes, however, the southern stars
would serve better for this purpose, since the circle of
northern circumpolar stars would be much restricted. Hence
there was a reason in such latitudes for preferring southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344"> 344</span>
stars. With regard both to high north and south stars, then,
we may in both cases be in presence of observations made
to determine the time at night. So that the worship of
Set, the determination of the time at night by means of
northern stars, might have been little popular with those
who at Gebel Barkal and elsewhere in the south had used
the southern ones for the same purpose, and this may be
one reason why the Theban priests, representing Nubian
astronomical culture and methods, were pledged to drive
the cult of Sutech out of the land.</p>

<p>Since, then, the observations of γ Draconis might be used
to herald the sunrise almost all the year round; and since
the modern constellation Draco is the old Hippopotamus,
we can readily understand Plutarch's statement that "Taurt
presides over the birth of the sun," and why Taurt or Mut
should be called the Mistress of Darkness.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>It does not seem too much to hope that the continuation
of such inquiries may ultimately enable us to solve several
points connected with early Egyptian history. We read in
Brugsch:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>"According to Greek tradition, the primitive abode of
the Egyptian people is to be sought in Ethiopia, and the
honour of founding their civilisation should be given to a
band of priests from Meroë. Descending the Nile, they are
supposed to have settled near the later city of Thebes, and
to have established the first state with a theocratic form of
government.</p>

<p>"But it is not to Ethiopian priests that the Egyptian Empire
owes its origin, its form of government, and its high
civilisation; much rather was it the Egyptians themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345"> 345</span>
that first ascended the river to found in Ethiopia temples,
cities, and fortified places, and to diffuse the blessings of a
civilised state among the rude dark-coloured population.</p>

<p>... "Strange to say, the whole number of the buildings
in stone, as yet known and examined, which were erected
on both sides of the river by Egyptian and Ethiopian kings,
furnish incontrovertible proof that the long series of temples,
cities, sepulchres, and monuments in general, exhibit a distinct
chronological order, of which the starting-point is found in
the pyramids, at the apex of the Delta."</p>

<p>It must be emphatically stated that the results obtained
from these monuments, studying them from the astronomical
point of view, lead to a very different conclusion. Instead
of one series, there are distinctly two (leaving out of consideration
the great pyramid builders at Gîzeh) absolutely
dissimilar astronomically; and instead of one set of temple-builders
going up the river, there were at least two sets, one
going <i>up</i> the river building temples to north stars, the other
going <i>down</i> building temples to south stars; and the two
streams practically met at Thebes, or at all events they
were both very fully represented there, either together or
successively.</p>

<p>The double origin of the people thus suggested on astronomical
grounds may be the reason of the name of "double
country," used especially in the titles of kings, of the
employment of two crowns, and finally of the supposed
sovereignty of Set over the north, and of Horus over the
south divisions of the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Only by the time of Seneferu was there anything like an
amalgamation of the peoples. He first was "King of the two
Egypts,"<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> while later Chephren called himself "Horus
and Sit"<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346"> 346</span>&mdash;a distinct indication,
I take it,
that the influence
of Upper Egypt
was already felt
as early as Seneferu,
and, I think,
much earlier, although
all <i>temple</i>
trace of it is lost.</p>

the start-point of

who came down

no orientation evidence,
for the
reason that there
is little or no

Naga there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347"> 347</span>
gap; but since important structures were erected at the places
named in early times (my inquiries suggest 3000-4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
it is probable that the peoples who built them stretched
further towards the equator.</p>

<p>But although the orientation evidence is lacking for
the lower latitudes, the inscriptions are by no means silent,
and over and over again it is stated that those particular
gods whom I have found to be associated with southern stars
came from a locality called the land of Pun-t.</p>

(<i>Dêr el-Bahari Inscriptions.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Pun-t was always considered a "Holy Land." Hathor
was "Queen of the Holy Land," "Mistress and Ruler of
Pun-t." Amen-Rā was "Hak" or "King" of Pun-t, and
Horus was the Holy Morning Star which rose to the
west (?) of the land of Pun-t.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Maspero refers to an ancient tradition that the land
of Pun-t could be reached by going up the Nile, where
eventually one came to an unknown sea which bathed the
land of Pun-t. Was this one of the great lakes?<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348"> 348</span></p>

<p>Brugsch<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> is of opinion that Pun-t occupied the south and
west coasts of Arabia Felix, but Maspero and Mariette do
not agree with him. The two latter authorities identify it
with that part of the Somali-land which borders on the
Gulf of Aden. It is the Cinnamonifera regio or Aromatifera
regio of the ancients.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The inscriptions at Dêr el-Bahari make it quite certain
that Pun-t is in Africa. Hottentot Venuses, pile dwellings,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
elephants, to say nothing of the products of the country
referred to as among the freight of the ships on their homeward
voyage, distinctly point to Africa, and I think a
southern part of it. The Cynocephalus ape, perhaps, is
more doubtful.</p>

<p>The first organised expedition to Pun-t of which we hear
anything is that organised by Se-ān<sub>χ</sub>-ka-Rā, the last king
of the 11th <i>Theban</i> dynasty. This was a new traffic by
way of the Red Sea. There was then no canal in existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349"> 349</span>
joining the sea with the Nile; the expedition went by land
to Coptos.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p349.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CYNOCEPHALUS APE WITH MOON EMBLEM.</div>
</div>

<p>They further indicate, as Maspero suggests, that the expedition
of Hāt-shepset anchored up a river, and
not on the sea-shore. This, again, makes Africa
much more probable than Arabia.</p>

<p>If we agree that Pun-t is really in Africa,
south of Somali-land, there is a great probability
that the tradition referred to by Maspero is a
true one.</p>

<p>It is also to be pointed out that there is no
trace of the southern star temples along the
various roads to the Red Sea, while, on the other
hand, the earliest traces of northern star worship,
with the exception of Annu or On, occur along
one or other of them. There is distinct evidence
that Osiris, Horus, Hathor, Chnemu, Amen-Rā,
and Khons, are worships coming from the south.
With regard to Horus, it is necessary to discriminate, since
there were two distinct gods&mdash;Horus in Northern and Horus
in Southern Egypt, <i>and Horus of the south was the elder of
the two</i>.</p>

<p>The Hawk-god of Edfû, Harhouditi, the southern Horus,
had for servants a number of individuals called Masniu or
Masnitiu = blacksmiths. The Hawk-god of the Delta, the
northern Horus, Harsiisit, had for his entourage the Shesu
Horu.</p>

<p>Now Maspero has recently pointed out<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> that the southern
Horus may have been imported, not from Arabia Felix or
Somali-land, but from Central Africa! and in a most interesting
paper has called attention to some customs still extant among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350"> 350</span>
the castes of blacksmiths in Central Africa, which have
suggested to him that the followers of the Edfû Horus may
have come from that province.</p>

<p>He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"C'est du sud de l'Égypte que les forgerons sont remontés vers le nord; leur
siège primitif était le sud de l'Égypte, la partie du pays qui a le plus des rapports
avec les régions centrales de l'Afrique et leurs habitants."</p>
</div>

<p>Then, after stating the present conditions of these workers
in Equatorial Africa, where they enjoy a high distinction, he
concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Je pense qu'on peut se représenter l'Horus d'Edfou comme étant au début,
dans l'une de ses formes, le chef et le dieu d'une tribu d'ouvriers travaillant le
métal, ou plutôt travaillant le fer. On ne saurait en effet se dissimuler qu'il y
a une affinité réelle entre le fer et la personne d'Horus en certains mythes.
Horus est la face céleste (horou), le ciel, le firmament, et ce firmament est de
toute antiquité, un toit de fer, si bien que le fer en prit le nom de ba-ni-pit,
métal du ciel, métal dont est formé le ciel: Horus l'aîné, Horus d'Edfou, est
donc en réalité un dieu de fer. Il est, de plus, muni de la pique ou de la javeline
à point de fer, et les dieux qui lui sont apparentés, Anhouri, Shou, sont de
piquiers comme lui, au contraire des dieux du nord de l'Égypte, Rā, Phtah, etc.,
qui n'ont pas d'armes à l'ordinaire. La légende d'Harhouditi conquérant
l'Égypte avec les masniou serait-elle donc l'écho lointain d'un fait qui se serait
passé au temps antérieurs à l'histoire? Quelque chose comme l'arrivée des
Espagnols au milieu des populations du Nouveau Monde, l'irruption en Égypte
de tribus connaissant et employant le fer, ayant parmi elles une caste de forgerons
et apportant le culte d'un dieu belliqueux qui aurait été un Horus ou se serait
confondu avec l'Horus des premiers Egyptiens pour former Harhouditi. Ces
tribus auraient été nécessairement d'origine Africaine, et auraient apporté de
nouveaux éléments Africains à ceux que renfermait déjà la civilisation du bas
Nil. Les forgerons auraient perdu peu à peu leurs privilèges pour se fondre au
reste de la population: à Edfou seulement et dans les villes ou l'on pratiquait le
culte de l'Horus d'Edfou, ils auraient conservé un caractère sacré et se seraient
transformés en un sorte de domesticité religieuse, les masniou du mythe d'Horus,
compagnons et serviteurs du dieu guerrier."</p>
</div>

<p>If we are to accept Maspero's suggestion that the elder
Horus really came from Central Africa, traces of the cult of
his followers should be found high up the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351"> 351</span></p>

<p>But such a search is now denied us, while in the time of
Thothmes III. it is supposed that the south frontier Kali of the
inscriptions is probably connected with Koloë in 4° 15′ N. lat.
according to Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there is distinct evidence of the cult
of the southern stars coming down the river in the region
we can get at; α Centauri, <i>e.g.</i>, seems to have been observed
at Gebel Barkal before Thebes&mdash;Sirius is too modern to be
considered&mdash;and above all there is the remarkable series of
temples, apparently oriented to Canopus before 6000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
which come down no lower than Edfû.</p>

<p>The general statement is, then, that there were two distinct
groups of stellar temples, probably built by different races, or at
all events by peoples having very different astronomical methods.</p>

<p>It is well to inquire here whether the dates of the various
temples as determined by the methods dwelt on in previous
chapters can throw any light upon the inquiry. Here I must
re-state that in almost every case the date of foundation so
determined precedes the generally-received date, which invariably
has reference to a stone building, while in all
probability the first structure was a brick shrine merely. In
support of this view I may state that the looking after ruined
shrines was recognised as one of the duties of kingship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have caused monuments to be raised to the gods; I have embellished
their sanctuaries that they may last to posterity; I have kept up their temples;
I have restored again what was fallen down, and have taken care of that which
was erected in former times."<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Not only did Thothmes III. find the original temple of
Amen-Rā built in brick, but he found the temple at Semneh
in brick also, and he rebuilt it in memory of Usertsen III.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352"> 352</span></p>

<p>In the following table I bring together the foundation dates
I have found most probable, bearing the above and many other
considerations in mind. The dates are, of course, only provisional,
since local data are in many cases wanting. Where
no information is forthcoming as to the height of the horizon
visible along the temple axis, I have assumed hills 1° high,
and used the dates printed in heavy type in Chapter XXX.</p>

<p>The following general conclusions may be drawn from
the table:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. At the earlier periods there are well-marked epochs of
temple-building revealed by the table.</p>

<p>II. If we can accept the possible Canopus temples referred
to in Chapter XXX., the oldest foundations in Egypt yet
traced are to southern stars. They are limited to Upper
Egypt, and date from before 6000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>III. The temples to the north stars, α Ursæ Majoris,
γ Draconis, and Capella (Set and Ptah), begin in the Delta
and about 1000 years later. The series is then broken till
about 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>IV. The south star temples to Phact at the summer solstice,
and α Centauri at the autumnal equinox, begin about
3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>V. γ Draconis replaces α Ursæ Majoris at Denderah;
north-star temples are for the first time erected in the south
at Karnak and Dakkeh in 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>VI. For the first time about 3200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, north-and south-star
temples are built simultaneously.</p>

<p>VII. After this the building activity is chiefly limited to
temples to southern stars.</p>

<p>If we take Brugsch's dates, we find that the foundations of
the greatest number of temples were laid about the time of
Seneferu, Pepi, and the twelfth dynasty. The more modern
kings founded few temples&mdash;their functions were those of
expanding, restoring, and <i>annexing</i>. Even Thothmes III.
seems to have laid no new foundations except perhaps that
of the Ptah temple at Karnak, and that is doubtful.</p>

<p>The wonderful Hall of Columns called Khu-mennu (Splendid
Memorial), in the temple of Amen-Rā, was dedicated by
Thothmes III. not only to Amen-Rā, but to his ancestors. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355"> 355</span>
is important to see who these were in the present connection.

<p>It is interesting to note that in this list the builders of
the great pyramids at Gîzeh, and all the kings who in the
last chapter were suggested as being given to equinoctial
worship, are passed over without notice. It would appear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356"> 356</span>
then, that the ancestors named were of southern origin,
precursors of Thothmes in cult as well as in time.</p>

<p>Of these ancestors, the first&mdash;if Brugsch's dates can be
taken, which, I think, is doubtful&mdash;limited himself to southern
temples; the majority of temples built near Pepi's time were
oriented to the south. The twelfth dynasty was more catholic.</p>

<p>The more we inquire, the more interesting does this
inquiry into the north-star temples as opposed to the south-star
temples become. These considerations are not limited
to the temples&mdash;they apply also to pyramids. At Gîzeh we
find both temples and pyramids oriented east and west.
At Gebel Barkal, Nuri, and Meroë, in Upper Egypt, we
find both temples and pyramids facing south-east, and at the
first of these places, where both exist together, we find well-marked
groups of pyramids connected by their orientations
with each temple. I can, however, find no information as to
the probable dates of these pyramids; in the absence of
facts, it seems fair to assume that they follow the dates of
the temples which agree in orientation.</p>

<p>In the following tables I give the values for Nuri, Meroë,
and Gebel Barkal; a west variation of 8½° has been assumed.</p>

<p>It seems quite justifiable from the above facts to conclude
that the pyramids and temples oriented S.E. and, as I hold,
to α Centauri when it heralded the autumnal equinox, were
not built by people having the same astronomical ideas,
worships, and mythology as those who built at Gîzeh due E.
and W., and marked the autumnal equinox by the heliacal
rising of Antares.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The only thing in common was noting
an equinox, and so far as this goes we may infer that neither
people dwelt originally in the Nile Valley, but came by
devious ways from a country or countries where the equinoxes
had been made out.</p>

<small>THE ORIGIN OF EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY&mdash;THE NORTHERN
SCHOOLS.</small></h2></div>


<p>So far we have dealt with the dawn of astronomy in Egypt.
We have found that from the earliest times there were astronomical
observations carried on, and that practically there were
three schools of thought. To all three schools sun-worship was
common, but we may clearly separate them by the associated
star-worship. We have found worshippers of northern stars,
east and west stars, and southern stars.</p>

<p>The northern star-worshippers we may associate with
Annu, the east and west star cult with the pyramid fields at
Gîzeh, and the southern star-worshippers with Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>What we have to do in the present chapter is to see whether
the orientation of the structures helps us with any suggestions
touching the question whether we have to stop at the places
named and acknowledge Egypt to be the true cradle of astronomical
science; or whether the facts we have considered compel
us to go a stage further back, and to recognise that the true
origin was elsewhere; that, in short, astronomy, instead of
taking its rise in Egypt, was simply imported thither.</p>

<p>It would appear from the recent work of the students of the
languages of Babylonia and Assyria that in these countries,
if anywhere, there might have been civilisations more ancient
than the Egyptian, which have already been glimpsed.</p>

<p>But before I go further something must be said about
Babylonia itself, for the reason that it also was the meeting-ground
of at least two different schools of astronomical thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360"> 360</span>
The facts connected with this subject are still to a certain
extent involved in obscurity, which is little to be wondered at
when we think how recently any knowledge has been available
to throw light upon the past of these regions. I need, however,
only briefly refer to them, and for this purpose shall use
the two most recently published books dealing with the question
which at present concerns us. I refer to Prof. Sayce's
"Hibbert Lectures" and Prof. Jensen's "Kosmologie der
Babylonier."</p>

<p>But what period are we to take?</p>

<p>It follows from the investigation into the orientation of
Egyptian temples that the stars α Ursæ Majoris, Capella,
Antares, Phact, and α Centauri were carefully observed, some
of them as early as 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the others between 4000 and
3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> I have also shown that it is possible that at Edfû
and Philæ the star Canopus may have been observed as early as
6400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Further, that the constellations of the Thigh (Ursa
Major), the Hippopotamus (Draco), the Bull, and the Scorpion
had been established in pyramid times.</p>

<p>It becomes important, therefore, if we recognise this as the
dawn of astronomy in Egypt, to see if any information is
extant giving us information concerning Babylonia, so that we
may be able to compare the observations made in the two
regions, not only with a view of tracing the relative times at
which they were made, but to gather from these any conclusions
that may be suggested in the course of the inquiry.</p>

<p>The inquiry must be limited to certain detailed points;
we know quite well already, as I have stated before, that
the omen tablets, which mention a king called Sargon
(probably Sargon I. of Agade), who reigned in Babylon
about 3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, prove unquestionably that astronomy had
been cultivated for thousands of years before the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361"> 361</span>
Era.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But to institute a comparison we must leave the
general and come to the particular. I will begin with
the northern constellations, as it follows from my researches
that very early at Annu and Denderah temples were erected
for their worship&mdash;the worship of Anubis or Set, as I have
shown before; that is, of α Ursæ Majoris and γ Draconis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Annu School. The Worship of Set.</span></h3>

<p>According to Maspero, Set formed one of the divine
dynasties at Annu, and the northern stars seem to have been
worshipped there. I suppose there is now no question among
Egyptologists that the gods Set, Sit, Typhon, Bes, Sutekh, are
identical. To this list possibly Ombo and Nubi should be
added.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is also equally well known that Sutekh was a
god of the Canaanites,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and Bes is identified with Set in the
Book of the Dead.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>It is also stated by Maspero that at Memphis<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> (time not
given) there were temples dedicated to "Sutekh" and "Baal."
In the chapter on the circumpolar stars I have suggested that
they were taken as typifying the powers of darkness and of the
lower world, and I believe it is conceded by Egyptologists that
Anubis in jackal form was either contemporaneous with or preceded
Osiris in this capacity.</p>

<p>In the exact centre of the circular zodiac of Denderah we
find the jackal located at the pole of the equator; it obviously
represents the present Little Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362"> 362</span></p>

<p>Now, do we get any Babylonian connection so far as we
have gone?</p>

<p>We learn, to begin with, from Pierret<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> that the hippopotamus,
the emblem of Set and Typhon, was the hieroglyph
of the Babylonian god "Baal."</p>

<p>Do we get the jackal constellation in Babylonian astronomy?
Of this there is no question, and in early times.
Jensen refers<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> to the various readings "jackal" and
"leopard," and states that it is only doubtful whether by
this figure the <i>god</i> <span class="smcap">Anu</span> or the <i>pole of the ecliptic</i> <span class="smcap">Anu</span> is
meant. Either will certainly serve our present purpose, and
a leopard in Babylonia might as easily symbolise the night
as a jackal in Northern Egypt.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that the jackal, leopard, hyæna,
black pig (wild boar), and hippopotamus were chosen as the
representatives of the god of evil and darkness (associated
with the circumpolar constellations), on account of their
ravages on flocks and herds and crops. If this be agreed,
nothing is more proper than that the jackal should be associated
with North Egypt, the hippopotamus with South Egypt, and
the wild boar with a latitude to the north of Egypt (and
perhaps of Nineveh) altogether. The representative of the
god of darkness, then, depended upon the latitude. In this
connection I may state that Drs. Sclater and Salvin have
quite recently referred me to an interesting paper by the
late Mr. Tomes<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> on the habit of the hippopotamus when
it comes out of the water to exude a blood-coloured fluid
from special pores in its skin. This explains at once why
Typhon took the form of a <i>red</i> hippopotamus, and why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363"> 363</span>
Mr. Irving, on the modern stage, couples Mephistopheles, the
modern devil, with red fire.</p>

<p>I know not whether the similarity in the words Anu, Annu
and An results merely from a coincidence, but it is certainly
singular that the most ancient temples in Lower Egypt
(Heliopolis and Denderah) should be called Annu or An<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> if
there be no connection with the Babylonian god Anu.</p>

<p>With regard to Anubis, it is quite certain that the seven
stars in Ursa Minor make a very good jackal with pendent tail,
as generally represented by the Egyptians (<i>see</i> page 276), and
that they form the nearest compact constellation to the pole
of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>The worship of Anubis as god of the dead, or the night
god, whether associated with the Babylonian Anu or not, was
supreme till the time of Men-Kau-Rā, the builder of the third
pyramid of Gîzeh<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> (3633 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Brugsch; 4100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Mariette).
Osiris is not mentioned. The coffin-lid of this king with the
prayer to Osiris "marks a new religious development in the
annals of Egypt. The absorption of the justified soul in
Osiris, the cardinal doctrine of the Ritual of the Dead, makes
its appearance here for the first time."</p>

<p>It seems extremely probable, therefore, that the worship of
the circumpolar stars went on in Babylonia as well as in Egypt
in the earliest times we can get at.</p>

<p>A very wonderful thing it is that, apparently in very early
times, the Babylonians had made out the pole of the equator
as contradistinguished from the pole of the ecliptic. This they
called Bīl. With this Jensen finds no star associated,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> but
6000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> this pole would be not far removed from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364"> 364</span>
stars in the present constellation Draco, out of which I have
suggested that the old Egyptian asterism of the hippopotamus
was formed.</p>

<p>Nor was this all; movements in relation to the ecliptic had
been differentiated from movements in relation to the equator.
We have inscriptions running:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>The way in reference to Anu</i>," that is the ecliptic with its pole at Anu.</p>

<p>"<i>The way in reference to Bīl</i>," the equator with its pole at Bīl.</p>
</div>

<p>In other words, the daily and yearly apparent movements
of the heavenly bodies were clearly distinguished, while we
note also</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Kabal šami</i>, "the middle of the heavens," defining the meridian.</p>
</div>

<p>So far as I can make out, when Anubis was supreme in
Egypt, the only sun-gods at Memphis and Annu were Rā
and Atmu. Ptah appears to have been a mixed sun-star god,
<i>i.e.</i>, Capella heralding the sunrise in the Harvest Time.</p>

<p>Now I learn from Prof. Sayce<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> that in Babylonia Anu and
Bīl ranked as two members of a triad from the commencement
of the Semitic period, the third member being probably a
southern star symbolised as we shall see in the sequel; it is
only in later times in Babylonia apparently that we get a triad
consisting of sun, moon, and Venus,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Venus being replaced at
Babylon by Sirius.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>To the two northern divinities temples were built; both
were worshipped in one temple at Babylon,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> which must therefore
have been oriented due north; and the pole of the equator
(the altitude of which is equal to the latitude of the place) was
probably in some way indicated. Here there was no rising
or setting observation, for Eridu, the most southern of the
old Babylonian cities, had about the same latitude as Bubastis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365"> 365</span>
in Egypt. The pole of the ecliptic (Anu) would revolve round
the pole of the equator (Bīl) always above the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="gap6r">So that since</span> Sutekh = Anu</p>
<p><span class="gap6lr">and</span> Baal = Bīl,</p>


<p class="pnind">the temple at Memphis to those divinities reported by
Maspero (see <i>ante</i>) must have been oriented in the same way
as the one at Babylon, that is to the north; and if the above
evidence be considered strong enough to enable us to associate
the Babylonian Bīl with the Egyptian Taurt, we have not
only Ursa Minor but Draco represented in the early worship
and mythology both of Egypt and of Babylonia.</p>

<p>According to Prof. Sayce<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> there is distinct evidence of
a change of thought with regard to Anu in Babylonia&mdash;there
certainly were great changes of thought in Egypt with regard
to Anubis. Observations of stars near the pole of the ecliptic
appear to have been utilised before they were taken as representing
either the superior or inferior powers&mdash;before, in fact,
the Anubis or Set stage <i>quá</i> Egypt was reached. After this
had been accomplished there was still another advance, in
which Anu assigns places to sun, moon, and evening star, and
symbolises the forces of nature.</p>

<p>There is evidence, though unfortunately it is very meagre,
that the temple worship was very similar in the two countries.</p>

<p>In the ceremonials in the temples the statues of the gods in
boats or arks were always carried in procession.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The same
rectangular arrangement of temples which held in Egypt, held
also in Babylonia, and this perhaps may be the reason why Bīl
seems so often to refer to the sun, whereas it was the name
given to the combined worship. Sometimes, on the other
hand, the worship of the stars is distinctly referred to as taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366"> 366</span>
place in a solar temple. Thus at Marduk's temple, E-Sagili,
we are told that "two hours after nightfall the priest must
come and take of the waters of the river; must enter into
the presence of Bīl, and putting on a stole in the presence
of Bīl must say this prayer," etc.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The temple, then, will
probably have been oriented to the north. Night prayers in
a sun-temple afford pretty good indications of a mixed cult.</p>

<p>The evidence, then, seems conclusive that by the time of
the founding of the temple at Annu a knowledge of the stars
near the pole of the equator, and of the importance of observing
them, was common to N. Egypt and to the region N.E.
of it. Whether the worship of Set was introduced into Egypt
from this region, or whether there was a common origin, must
for the present, then, remain undetermined.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Equinoctial School&mdash;The Worship of the Spring-Sun.</span></h3>

<p>The East and West orientation, as we have seen, is chiefly
remarkable at the pyramids of Gîzeh and the associated temples,
but it is not confined to them.</p>

<p>The argument in favour of these structures being the work
of intruders is that a perfectly new astronomical idea comes in,
one not represented at Annu and quite out of place in Egypt,
with the solstitial rising river, as the autumnal equinox was at
Eridu, with the river rising at the spring equinox.</p>

<p>We are justified from what is known regarding the rise of
the Nile as dominating and defining the commencement of the
Egyptian year at the solstice, in concluding that other ancient
peoples placed under like conditions would act in the same
way; and if these conditions were such that spring would
mean sowing-time and autumn harvest-time, their year would
begin at an equinox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367"> 367</span></p>

<p>Now what the valley of the Nile was to Egypt those of the
Tigris and the Euphrates were to the Babylonian empire. Like
the Nile, these valleys were subject to annual inundations, and
their fertility depended, as in Egypt, upon the manner in which
the irrigation was looked after.</p>

<p>But unlike the Nile, the commencement of the inundation of
these rivers took place near the vernal equinox; hence the year,
we may assume, began then, and, reasoning by analogy, the
worship in all probability was equinoctial.</p>

<p>A people entering Egypt from this region, then, would
satisfy one condition of the problem. But is there any evidence
that this people built their solar temples and temple walls east
and west, and that they also built pyramids?</p>

<p>There is ample evidence (referred to in Chapter IX.)&mdash;although,
alas! the structures in Babylonia, being generally built
in brick and not in stone, no longer remain, as do those erected
in Egypt. Still, in spite of the absence of the possibility of a
comparative study, research has shown that in the whole region
to the north-east of Egypt the temenos walls of temples and the
walls of towns run east and west; and though at present actual
dates cannot be given, a high antiquity is suggested in the
case of some of them. Further, as has been already pointed
out, the temples which remain in that region where stone
was procurable, as at Palmyra, Baalbek, Jerusalem, all lie east
and west.</p>

<p>But more than this, it is well known that from the very
earliest times pyramidal structures, called ziggurats, some 150
feet high, were erected in each important city. These were
really observatories; they were pyramids built in steps, as is
clearly shown from pictures found on contemporary tablets;
and one with seven steps and of great antiquity, it is known,
was restored by Nebuchadnezzar II. about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368"> 368</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_p368" style="max-width: 50em;">

  <div class="caption">STATUE OF CHEPHREN, FOUND IN THE TEMPLE NEAR THE SPHINX.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369"> 369</span></p>

<p>A careful study of the historical references to the various
pyramids built in Egypt, leaves it beyond doubt that the
step pyramids are the oldest. They could, then, most easily
have been constructed on the Babylonian model, and in this
fact we have an additional argument for the intrusion of the
pyramid builders into Egypt from Babylonia.</p>

<p>But did this equinox-worshipping, pyramid-building race
live at anything like the time required?</p>

<p>There is no doubt now in the minds of scholars that the
evidence is conclusive that among the kings of Babylonia were
the following:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>


<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdl">B.C.</td>

<td class="tdl">3800</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Sargon I.</td>
<td class="tdl">3750</td>

</table>


<p>The date of the earliest known pyramid in Egypt may
perhaps be put down as about 3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (Brugsch), or 4200
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (Mariette).</p>

<p>Hence it seems that a third line of evidence is in favour
of the Babylonian intrusion. There was undoubtedly an
equinox-worshipping, pyramid-building race existing in Babylonia
at the time the Egyptian pyramids are supposed to have
been built.</p>

<p>Another connecting link is found in the statues of
Chephren discovered in the temple at the pyramids, and
at Tel-loh (ancient Lagash) by M. de Sarzec in 1881. This
last find consisted of some large statues of diorite, and the
attitude is nearly identical with that of Chephren himself as
represented in the statues in the museum of Gîzeh.</p>

<p>This indicates equality in the arts, and the possession of
similar tools, in Chaldæa and Egypt about the time in question.
Further it is supposed that the diorite out of which both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370"> 370</span>
series of statues were fashioned came out of the same quarry
in Sinai. The characters in which the inscriptions are written
are in what is termed "line" Babylonian&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, they resemble
pictures more than cuneiform characters; and the standard of
measurement marked upon the plan of the city, which one
of the figures of Tel-loh holds upon his knees, is the same as
the standard of measurement of the Egyptian pyramid builders&mdash;the
cubit of 20·63, not the Assyro-Babylonian cubit of 21·6.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Now, although with regard to the cult of the northern stars
it was impossible to decide whether the Egyptian school of
astronomers came from Babylonia or from a source common to
both countries, it is clear that with regard to the equinoctial
cult we are limited absolutely to Babylonia as the special
source. The coincidence in time of the same kind of buildings
and the same art in the two countries puts a common origin
out of the question.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, so far as we have gone, both the north-star
worship and the equinoctial worship were imported into Egypt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY (CONTINUED)&mdash;THE
THEBES SCHOOL.</small></h2></div>


<p>The next question which arises now that we have considered
the facts relating to the astronomy of Northern Egypt is one
connected with the cults which we have proved to come down
the Nile. Were they indigenous or imported?</p>

<p>Although I have put it forward with all reserve, there is
evidence which suggests that the temples so far traced sacred
to the southern cult are of earlier foundation than those to the
north; and they are associated with Edfû and Philæ, which are
known to be of high antiquity. This is one point of difference.
Another is that the almost entire absence of Set temples and
east and west pyramids up the river indicates that, so far
as these structures go, we lack the links which astronomically
and mythologically connect the Delta with Babylonia either
directly or by common origin.</p>

<p>From Prof. Sayce it is to be gathered that the most ancient
people yet glimpsed there inhabited the region at the head
of the Persian Gulf, one of the chief cities being Eridu, now
represented by the mounds of Abu Shahrên on the eastern
bank of the Euphrates. It was founded as a maritime city,
but is now far inland, owing to the formation of the delta, the
alluvium of which at the present time advances about sixty-six
feet a year.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This alone is an argument in favour of
its high antiquity.</p>

<p>Along with the culture of Eridu went the worship of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372"> 372</span>
god of Eridu, the primal god of Babylonia, Ea, Ía, or Oannes,
symbolised as a goat-fish, and connected in some way with the
sun when in Capricornus.</p>

<p>This, Jensen, by his wonderful analysis (would that I could
completely follow it in its marvellous philological twistings,
pages 73-81) puts beyond question; and he clinches the argument
by showing that our "tropic of Capricorn" of to-day&mdash;the
goat still represented on our globes of to-day with a fish's
tail!&mdash;was called by the Babylonians "the path followed by
Ía" or in relation to Ía.</p>

<p>This Ía was such a great god that to him was assigned
the functions of Maker of Men; he was also a great potter
and art workman (p. 293), a point I shall return to presently.
He eventually formed a triad with Anu and Bīl, that is, the
poles of the heavens and the equator.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>


<h3><i>The God of Eridu.</i></h3>

<p>Let us assume that the earliest sun-god traced at Eridu was
the sun-god of those early argonauts who founded the colony.</p>

<p>We are told that this god was the son of Ía, and that
his name was Tammuz; he was in some way associated with
Asari (? Osiris) (Sayce, p. 144), who, according to Jensen,
represented the Earth (p. 195); of the Moon we apparently
hear nothing.</p>

<p>This Tammuz (Dumuzi), we find, ultimately became "the
Nergal of Southern Chaldæa, the sun-god of winter and
night, who rules, like Rhadamanthos, in the lower world"
(Sayce, p. 245), and as lord of Hades he was made son of Mul-lil
(Sayce, p. 197).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373"> 373</span></p>

<p>This was at first. But what do we find afterwards?</p>

<p>Nergal is changed into the Midsummer Sun! (Jensen, p.
484). And finally he is changed into the Spring Sun Marduk
at Babylon (Sayce, p. 144)<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> where he is recognised as the son
of Ía and Duazag, that is the Eastern Mountain (Jensen, p. 237).</p>

<p>Now, however difficult it may be to follow these changes
from the religious point of view, from the astronomical side
they are not only easily explained, but might have been predicted,
provided one hypothesis be permitted, namely, that
the colony who founded Eridu were originally inhabitants of
some country where the chief agricultural operations were
carried on about the time of the Autumnal Equinox in the
northern hemisphere.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374"> 374</span></p>

<p>This country might lie south of the equator, and indeed
we find one which answers the requirements in the region of
the great lakes and on the coast opposite Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Such an hypothesis may at first sight appear strange, but
the view that Eridu was colonised from Cush has been supported
by no less an authority than Lepsius.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The boundaries
of Cush are not defined, but they may possibly include the
Land of Pun-t, from which certainly part of the Egyptian
culture was derived.</p>

<p>Among all early peoples the most important times of the
year must necessarily have been those connected with seed-time
and harvest in each locality. Now the spring equinox
and summer solstice south of the equator are represented by
the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice to the north of
it. If the colonists who came to Eridu came from a region
south of the equator, they would naturally have brought not
only their southern stars, but their southern seasons with
them; but their springtime was the northern autumn, their
summer solstice the northern winter. This could have gone
on for a time, and we see that their sun-god was the god
of the winter solstice, Tammuz-Nergal.</p>

<p>But it could only have gone on for a time; the climatic
facts were against such an unnatural system,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and the old condition
could have been brought back by calling the new winter
summer, or in other words making the winter-god into the
summer sun-god&mdash;in short, changing Nergal into a midsummer
sun-god. This it seems they did.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375"> 375</span></p>

<p>But why the further change of Nergal to Marduk?
Because the northern races were always tending southwards,
being pushed from behind, while the supply of Eridu culture
was not being replenished. The religion and astronomy of the
north were continually being strengthened, and among this
astronomy was the cult of the sun at the vernal equinox, the
springtime of the northern hemisphere, sacred to Marduk.
Nergal, therefore, makes another stage onward, and is changed
into Marduk!</p>

<p>It is also interesting to find that in Ninib, another sun-god,
we have almost the exact counterpart of the Egyptian Horus.
He is the eastern morning sun, the son of Asari (? Osiris), and
the god of agriculture.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>I append here the most recent translation of the hymn to
the sun-god, referred to in the Introduction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"O Sun (god)! on the horizon of heaven thou dawnest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bolt of the pure heaven thou openest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The door of heaven thou openest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Sun (god)! thou liftest up thy head to the world;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Sun (god)! thou coverest the earth with the majestic brightness of heaven."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Marduk, then, the son of Ea, or Ía, was finally as definite a
spring equinox sun-god as Amen-Rā in Egyptian mythology
was a summer solstice sun-god.</p>

<p>We have, then, the undoubted facts that in Southern
Babylonia, to start with, the sun-worship had to do with the
winter half of the year. As the Babylonian culture advanced
northward from Eridu and met the Semitic culture, the winter
season was changed for the spring equinox&mdash;that is, a worship
identical with that of the pyramid builders who intruded into
Northern Egypt.</p>


<h3><i>The Myths of Horus and Marduk.</i></h3>

<p>In my references to the myth of Horus in Chapter XIV.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376"> 376</span>
I have shown that in all probability an astronomical meaning
is that the rising sun puts out the northern stars. It
was also indicated that the myth was one of great antiquity,
as it was formulated when Draco was circumpolar; was not
simple in its nature, and probably had reference to a sun-worshipping
race abolishing the cult of Set representing the
northern stars.</p>

<p>The facts brought together in subsequent chapters show
that if there were not such a myth, there should have been;
for the temple evidence alone showing the antithesis between
Osiris-worship and the worship of Set is overwhelming.</p>

<p>I have also indicated that temples built to northern stars
are geographically separated from those built to southern
ones, and that the former have had their axes blocked to
prevent the worship.</p>

<p>The Horus of Edfû, who is represented as leading the
victorious hosts who revenge the killing of Osiris by Set,
is the ally of the southern-star worshippers whom we have
traced from Thebes, possibly to Central Africa (see page <a href="#Page_350">350</a>);
and if we associate the myth with the records on the walls
of the temple of Edfû, and agree to the possibility of that
temple having been founded in 6400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see page <a href="#Page_311">311</a>), then
there must have been an invasion of the southern peoples
about that date&mdash;an invasion which reached Northern Egypt,
where eventually they were conquered by the Set-worshipping
race, who came, as I think I have proved, from a
country to the N.E. of the Delta. The question is: Did
this first colony represent the original Hor-Shesu, so-called
specially because perhaps as a novelty they had <i>added</i> the
worship of the sun to the worship of the moon? and was
the moon the first Osiris brought in by moon-worshippers
with a year of 360 days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377"> 377</span></p>

<p>In Accad and Sumer, where also, according to Hommel
and others, the word Osiris (Asari) has been traced, the
sun-god was the daughter of the moon-god. An eye forms
part both of the hieroglyphic and of the cuneiform name, and
the eye was one of the symbols in the name of Osiris in
Egypt. Be this as it may, we have temple evidence to
show that in Egypt the worship of Set was the worship
of a northern race, and that it was finally abolished by
a southern one.</p>

<p>Now in Babylonia exactly the opposite happened. The
proto-Chaldæan south-star and winter-sun cult of Eridu
was ultimately changed, absorbed, and buried in the Semitic
cult of the northern stars Anu and Bīl and the spring sun,
first Marduk and afterwards Šamaš.</p>

<p>Had there been then myth-makers in Babylonia, the myth
would have been the converse of the Egyptian one. There
were myth makers, and precisely such a myth! It is called
the Myth of Marduk and Tiāmat.</p>

<p>The chief change had been in the sun-god. When the
northern cult conquered, the exotic worship of the autumn
and winter constellations was abolished, and they were pictured
as destroyed under the form of Tiāmat, although the
worship was once as prominent as that of Set in Egypt.
We have the later developed northern spring-sun Marduk
destroying the evil gods or spirits of winter; and chief
among them, of course, the Goat-fish, which, from its central
position, would represent the winter solstice.</p>

<p>The myth, then, has to do with the fact that the autumn-and
winter-sun-worship of Eridu was conquered by the
spring-sun-worship of the north.</p>

<p>If we accept this, we can compare the Egyptian and
Babylonian myths from the astronomical point of view in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378"> 378</span>
the following manner; and a wonderful difference in the
astronomical observations made, as well as in the form,
though not in the basis, of astronomical mythology in Egypt
and in Babylonia is before our eyes. Astronomically in both
countries we are dealing with the dawn preceding sunrise
on New Year's Day, and the accompanying extinction of
the stars.</p>

<p>But which stars? In Egypt there is no question that
the stars thus fading were thought of as being chiefly represented
by the stars which never set&mdash;that is, the circumpolar
ones, and among them the Hippopotamus chiefly. In
Babylonia we have to do with the ecliptic constellations.</p>

<p>Now I believe that it is generally recognised that Marduk
was relatively a late intruder into the Babylonian pantheon.
If he were a god brought from the north by a conquering
race (whether conquering by craft or <i>kraft</i> does not matter),
and his worship replaced that of ['I]a, have we not, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, the exact counterpart of the Egyptian myth of
Horus? In the one case we have a southern star-worshipping
race ousting north-star worshippers, in the other a northern
equinoctial sun-worshipping race ousting the cult of the
moon and solstitial sun. In the one case we have Horus, the
rising sun of every day, slaying the Hippopotamus (that is,
the modern Draco), the regent of night; in the other,
Marduk, the spring-sun-god, slaying the animals of Tiāmat&mdash;that
is apparently the origin of the Scorpion, Capricornus,
and Pisces, the constellations of the winter months, which
formed a belt across the sky from east to west at the vernal
equinox.</p>

<p>The above suggested basis of the Babylonian mythology
regarding the demons of Tiāmat, established when the sun
was in Taurus at the spring equinox, enables us to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379"> 379</span>
clearly the much later (though similar) imagery employed
when the sun at the equinox had passed from Taurus
to Aries&mdash;when the Zend Avesta was written, and after the
twelve zodiacal constellations had been established. We find
them divided equally into the kingdoms of Ormazd and
Ahriman. Here I quote Dupuis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"L'agneau est aux portes de l'empire du bien et de la lumière, et la balance
à celles du mal et des ténèbres; l'un est le premier des signes supérieurs, et
l'autre des signes inférieurs.</p>

<p>"Les six signes supérieurs comprennent les six mille de Dieu, et les six
signes inférieurs les six mille du diable. Le bonheur de l'homme dure sous les
premiers signes, et son malheur commence au septième, et dure sous les six
signes affectés à Ahriman, ou au chef des ténèbres.</p>

<p>"Sous les six signes du règne du bien et la lumière, qui sont agneau, taureau
gémeaux, cancer, lion et vierge ou épi, nous avons marqué les états variés de l'air
et de la terre, qui sont le résultat de l'action du bon principe. Ainsi on lit
sous l'agneau ou sous le premier mille ces mots, printemps, zephyr, verdure; sous
le taureau, sève et fleur; sous les gémeaux, chaleurs et longs jours; sous le
cancer, été, beaux temps; sous le lion, épis et moissons; et sous la vierge,
vendanges.</p>

<p>"En passant à la balance, on trouve les fruits; la commence le règne du ma

aussi nous avons écrit ces mots, dépouillement de la nature; sous le scorpion
on lit froid; sous le sagittaire, neiges; sous le capricorne, glace et brouillard,
siège des ténèbres et de longs nuits; sous le verseau, pluies et frimas; sous les
poissons, vents impétueux."</p>
</div>

<p>Since the great pyramids were built in the time of the
fourth dynasty, it is quite clear that Eridu must have been
founded long before if the transitions were anything like
those I have stated.</p>


<h3><i>The Argument touching</i> η <i>Argus</i>.</h3>

<p>But there is not only evidence that at Eridu the sun-worship
was at first connected with the winter solstice. It is known
that there was star-worship as well; and there must have
been moon-worship too, judging by the moon-god of the
adjacent town of Ur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380"> 380</span></p>

<p>Associated with Ía was an Ía-star, which Jensen concludes
may be η Argûs. This we must consider.</p>

<p>Jensen concludes that the Ía-star is η Argûs on the
ground that many of the texts suggest a darkening of it
now and again; he very properly points out that a variability
in the star is the only point worth considering in
this connection, and by this argument he is driven to η,
which is one of the most striking variables in the heavens,
outshining Canopus at its maximum. Speaking generally,
everybody would agree that obscuration by clouds, etc.,
would not be recorded; but if the star were observed just
rising above the southern horizon only, then its absence,
due to such causes, would, I should fancy, be chronicled,
and it must not be forgotten that this is precisely the
region where the Ía star would be observed, if all of
the inscriptions referred to by Jensen are to be satisfied;
its place was in "<i>äussersten Süden</i>" (page 153). It was "<i>das
Pendant des im Nordpol des Aequators sitzenden Himmels-Bi'l</i>"
(page 148); "<i>Ía's 'Ort' am Himmel liegt im Süden</i>" (page 26).</p>

<p>There is another argument. Professor Sayce in his
lectures reproduces (page 437) Mr. George Smith's account
of the Temple of Bel derived from a Babylonian text.
The temple was oriented east and west. In a description
of one of the enclosures we read that on the northern side
was a temple of Ía, while on the southern side there was a
temple of Bīl and Anu. This not only shows that Ía was
regarded as sacred to the true south, but that the temple
buildings were planned like the Egyptian ones, the light
either from sun or star passing over the heads of the worshippers
in the courts into the temples. (Compare temple
M in the temple of Amen-Rā, page 118 <i>ante</i>.)</p>

<p>But η Argûs never rose or set anywhere near the south.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381"> 381</span>
I have ascertained that its declination was approximately
32° S. in 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and increased to 42° S. by about 2000
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Hence between these dates at Eridu its amplitude
varied between 38° and 51° S. of E. or W. Now here we
are far away from the S. point, though very near the S.E.
or S.W. point, to which it is stated some of the Babylonian
structures had their sides oriented.</p>

<p>The question arises whether there was a star which
answers the other conditions. <i>There was a series of such stars.</i></p>

<p>It may be here mentioned generally that the precessional
movement must, after certain intervals, cause this phenomenon
to be repeated constantly with one star after another.</p>

<p>Beginning with perhaps a sufficiently remote period, we
have:&mdash;</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><span class="gap6r">Achernar</span></td>

<p>These stars would appear very near the south point of the
horizon at Eridu at the dates stated, and describe a very
small arc above it between rising and setting at certain
times of the year.</p>

<p>Now to go a stage further in the study of the Ía&mdash;Ea
or Eridu&mdash;star, it is desirable to quote the legend concerning
Ía or Oannes derived from Bêrôssos through Alexander
Polyhistôr.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the first year there appeared in that part of the Erythraean sea
which borders upon Babylonia a creature endowed with reason, by name
Oannes, whose whole body (according to the account of Apollodôros) was
that of a fish; under the fish's head he had another head, with feet also
below similar to those of a man subjoined to the fish's tail. His voice, too,
and language were articulate and human; and a representation of him is
preserved even to this day.</p>

<p>"This being was accustomed to pass the day among men, but took no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382"> 382</span>
food at that season; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences
and arts of every kind. He taught them to construct houses, <i>to found
temples</i>,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of geometrical
knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and showed
them how to collect the fruits; in short, he instructed them in everything
which could tend to soften manners and humanise their lives. From that
time nothing material has been added by way of improvement to his
instructions. Now, when the sun had set, this being Oannes used to retire
again into the sea, and pass the night in the deep, for he was amphibious.
After this there appeared other animals like Oannes."</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the string of "other animals"
enumerated by Eusebius, but one of them is important. A
companion of Anôdaphas and Odakôn shows the true reading
to have been Anâdakôn&mdash;that is, Anu and Dagon. This
other animal, then, clearly refers to the introduction of
the northern Semitic cult, and hence the suggestion is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383"> 383</span>
strengthened that some of the earlier "other animals" who
subsequently appeared, like Ía (? Oannes), may really have
been new southern stars making their appearance in the
manner I have shown, and perhaps varying the cult.</p>

<p>The whole legend is, I think, clearly one relating to
men coming from the south (?) to Eridu in ships. The
boat is turned into a "fish-man," and the star to which
they pointed to show whence they came is made a god.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p383.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE TEMPLE AT AMADA.</div>
</div>

<p>It is evident the intrusion was from the south, because
otherwise extreme south stars would not have been in
question. We have, then, got so far. The worshippers of
the southern star and of the winter months, including the
solstice, were certainly not indigenous at Eridu. They
were probably introduced from the south, and they were
sea-borne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384"> 384</span></p>

<p>The next question which concerns us is, was this worship in
any way connected with Egypt?</p>

<p>One of the most definite and striking conclusions to which
the study of temples has led, is that in Southern Egypt the
temple worship was limited to southern stars, and, further, that
there is a chain of temples, possibly dating from 6400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and
oriented to Canopus. This certainly is an argument in favour
of a worship similar to that traced at Eridu.</p>

<p>But is there any trace of Ía or of his son, the sun-god?</p>

<p>This god was, as we have seen, associated in some way
with Asari. I am told that students will probably agree
that the connection between this word and the Egyptian
Osiris is absolute. Professor Sayce informs me that the
cuneiform ideograms and the hieroglyphs have the same
meaning, and indicate the same root-words.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Ía was represented as a goat-fish, and was a potter and
"maker of men." This being so, I confess the facts relating
to the southern Egyptian god Chnemu strike me as very
suggestive. He is represented goat-headed, and not ram-headed,
as generally stated; he is not only the creator of
mankind, but he is a potter, and he is actually represented at
Philæ as combining these attributes in making man out of clay
on a potter's wheel. Nay, according to Bunsen, he is stated to
have formed on his wheel the divine limbs of Osiris, and is
styled the "sculptor of all men."<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>I give the following extracts from Lanzoni (p. 956):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"χ<sup>{NUM.}</sup>&mdash;χ<sup>{num</sup>} [Chnemu] significa 'fabbricatore, modellatore.' ... Questo
demiurgo apparisce come una delle più it antiche divinità dell' Egitto, ed aveva

Esso era il dio delle cataratte, identificato al dio Nun, il Padre degli dei,

come una personificazione dell' Acqua dell' inondazione."</p>
</div>

<div class="figright illowp25" id="i_p385" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p385.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CHNEMU.</div>
</div>

<p>He is also Hormaχu, the god of the universe: The father
of the father of the gods: Creator of heaven, earth, water, and
mountains; a local form of Osiris. His wife was the frog-goddess,
Hekt (? Serk-t).</p>

<p>Further, he was also regarded as presiding
in some special way over water,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and, unlike
Amen-Rā, though like Ía, he has a position
among the gods of the lower world.</p>

<p>A sun-god, with uræus and disk, he is
closely associated with Amen-Rā, and if he
were one of the earliest of the South Egyptian
gods this could only be by Amen-Rā being
an emanation from him; the temples in any
case do not afford us traces of Amen-Rā before
3700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and Chnemu is recognised as one of
the oldest gods in Egypt, on the same platform
as Ptah in the North. If we assume a connection
with Eridu, then we are driven to the
conclusion that the Eridu culture came either
from Egypt or from a common source.</p>

<p>Here for the present the question must be left. I must be
content to remark that many of the facts point to a common
origin south of the equator. It is clear that if Chnemu were
a sun-god of the <i>Winter</i>, brought into Egypt from without,
the change to Amen-Rā is precisely what would have been
certain to happen, for in Egypt the Summer Solstice, over
which Amen-Rā presided, was all-important.</p>


<h3><i>Anthropological Evidence.</i></h3>

<p>It will be seen, then, that a general survey of Egyptian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386"> 386</span>
history does suggest conflicts between two races, and this of
course goes to strengthen the view that the temple-building
phenomena suggest two different worships, depending upon
race distinctions.</p>

<p>We have next to ask if there is any anthropological
evidence at our disposal. It so happens that Virchow has
directed his attention to this very point.</p>

<p>Premising that a strong race distinction is recognised
between peoples having brachycephalic or short, and dolichocephalic
or long, skulls, and that the African races belong to
the latter group, I may give the following extract from his
paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The craniological type in the Ancient Empire was
different from that in the middle and new. The skulls from
the Ancient Empire are brachycephalic, those from the new
and of the present day are either dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic;
the difference is therefore at least as great as that
between the dolichocephalic skulls of the Frankish graves and
the predominantly brachycephalic skulls of the present population
of South Germany. I do not deny that we have hitherto
had at our disposal only a very limited number of skulls from
the Ancient Empire which have been certainly determined;
that therefore the question whether the brachycephalic skull-type
deduced from these was the general or a least the predominant
one cannot yet be answered with certainty; but I
may appeal to the fact that the sculptors of the Ancient
Empire made the brachycephalic type the basis of their works
of art too."</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the anthropological as well as
the historical evidence runs on all fours with the results to be
obtained from such a study of the old astronomy as the temples
afford us.</p>

<small>GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH
RACES.</small></h2></div>


<p>It is now time to summarise the evidence concerning the
north and south temple builders, including those who built
pyramids as well.</p>

<p>To do this we must deal not only with the buildings,
but with the associated mythology, or, rather, with the
astronomical part of the mythology, for there seems to be
very little doubt that in the earliest times, before knowledge
replaced or controlled imagination, everything was mythologically
everything else in turn. It is for this reason
that trusting to genealogies especially seems like building
on sand. That Father-ship and Son-ship in the earliest
days were mythologically something quite different from
what the words in their strict sense imply to-day will be agreed
to by everybody; and there is evidence that many of the
absolute contradictions met with, and statements which it is
impossible to reconcile, may all depend upon the point of
view from which the mythological statements were made.</p>

<p>But when astronomy helps us to <i>the point of view</i>, the
mythological statements, and even the genealogies, become
much clearer and unmistakable, and contradiction vanishes
to a great extent; and it would seem as if genealogies
<i>en bloc</i> were never propounded, hence it was a commonplace
either that a god should be the father of his mother,
or that he should have no father.</p>

<p>Thus, in one sense, Rā is father of all the gods; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388"> 388</span>
in another Ptah is the creator of the egg of the sun
because Capella setting heralded sunrise at a particular time
of the year; and Isis is the <i>mother</i> of Horus because Phact =
α Columbæ, Serk-t = α Centauri, Mut = γ Draconis, and
other stars (Isis) did precisely the same; while in another
connection Isis is the sister of Osiris, and therefore the
<i>mother</i> of Horus. But here the relationship depends upon
the association of the moon and warning star in the morning
sky. I only offer these as suggestions; similar variations
might be multiplied <i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p>But while all this proves that genealogies may be
manufactured without either end or utility, we gather that
the association of mythological personages with definite
astronomical bodies may in time be of great help in such
inquiries, and ultimately enable us to raise the veil of
mystery by which these old ideas have of set purpose, and
partly by these means, been hidden.</p>

<p>There seems no doubt that we have got definite evidence
that the very oldest mythological personages were
closely connected either with the sun at some special time of
the year, with the moon, or with the rising and setting of
some star or another. Hence we ought to be able from
the temple evidence to classify the northern and southern
gods.</p>

<p>The establishment of Amen-Rā gives us a fair indication
of the changes which must have taken place among the early
civilisations when the beginning of the year was altered.
There can be no doubt, I think, that Chnemu was the first
Sun-god of Southern Egypt; the cryosphinxes at Thebes
are alone sufficient to prove it;<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and if so, then the
southern people must have come from a region where the
autumnal equinox marked the most important time of the
year for their agricultural operations. And this year had
eventually to give way, as we know it did, about 3700 B.C.,
for one beginning at the summer solstice.</p>

<p>In the above list I have indicated Osiris as a Moon-god.
Many inscriptions might be quoted similar to the following
one:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Salute a te, Hesiri, il signore dell' eternità. Quando tu sei in Cielo, tu
apparisci come sole, et tu rinnuovi la tua forma comme Luna."<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It has also to be borne in mind that the complicated head-dress,
including the goat's horns, is represented in connection
with Thoth Chnemu and Osiris.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Later he was unquestionably a sun-god, but this would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390"> 390</span>
certain to happen if the southern intruders worshipped the
moon in the first line.</p>

<p>Further, if in later times he represented both sun and
moon, as he certainly did, it is not probable that he did
so from the beginning. All the special symbolism refers to
him as a Moon-god; he is certainly a Moon-god in the
myth of Isis and Osiris, for he was cut into fourteen pieces,
the number of days of the waning moon.</p>

<p>Now, we can easily understand an evolution beginning
with a Moon-god and ending with a Sun-god. But the contrary
is almost unthinkable; besides, we know that in Egypt
it did not happen; the solar attributes got hardened as time
went on. The calendar evidence, as we have seen, in relation
to the original year of 360 days is in favour of Moon-worship,
and therefore of a Moon-god in the earliest times.</p>

<p>Further, if we accept this, the myth of Horus becomes a
complete historical statement, of which parts have already
been shown to refer to astronomical facts past all dispute.
It is well here to give Naville's remarks upon it. It will
be seen that they strengthen my view.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"La 363^{me} année de son règne, le dieu part avec son fils pour l'Égypte.
Voilà donc une date précise de l'un de ces rois qui, selon les traditions
égyptiennes, avaient occupé le trône de l'Égypte avant les souverains indigènes.
Cette année-là, Horhut chassé Typhon de l'Égypte, et s'établit en
roi sur tout le pays. Cela concorderait donc avec ce que nous disent Manéthon
et Eusèbe, que, dans la première dynastie des dieux, Typhon précéda
immédiatement Horus. La succession se serait faite par droit de conquête.</p>

<p>"Horus a avec lui des compagnons qui sont nommés partout ses suivants:
les Schesou Hor. M. de Rougé a déjà fait remarquer que, dans plusieurs
inscriptions, ces hommes sont considérés comme les habitants primitifs de
l'Égypte, les contemporains des dynasties divines. Ce sont ces Mesennou
dont il a déjà été question dans la série précédente. Le rôle qu'ils jouent
dans ce récit montre, plus clairement encore, que l'époque dont il s'agit est
la fin des temps mythologiques auxquels Ména devait succéder. C'est une<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391"> 391</span>
tradition relative aux événements qui ne doivent avoir précédé que de peu
les temps historiques.</p>

<p>"Horhut monte dans la barque de son père, qui le suit pendant toute
l'expédition, et lui donné son appui et ses conseils. Les dieux poursuivent
Typhon tout le long du fleuve; Horhut livre plusieurs batailles dans des
lieux qui recevront des noms propres à rappeler ses exploits, et qui seront
plus particulièrement voués à son culte. C'est à Edfon qu'ont lieu les premiers
combats, puis dans le 16<sup>me</sup> nome de la Haute-Égypte. Le nome de Mert, celui
du Fayoum et du lac Moeris, est le théâtre de plusieurs épisodes de la lutte.
C'est dans la ville de Sutenchenen, appelée ici Nanrutef, un sanctuaire important
d'Osiris, que s'établissent les Schesou Hor. Enfin, lorsque Set a été
chassé du nome de Chent-ab, le 14<sup>me</sup> de la Basse-Égypte, le pays est délivré,
et la royauté est assurée à Horhut. Son père, qui, à chaque nouvelle victoire,
lui a décerné quelque honneur special, lui accorde d'être représenté sous la
formé du disque ailé, ou du scarabée, sur tous les temples de la Haute et de
la Basse-Égypte. Horus devient le seigneur des deux régions, s'assied dans un
sanctuaire ou il est adoré comme Horchuti, avec qui il finit par se confondre.</p>

<p>"Telle est cette seconde légende, bien mieux caractérisée que la première,
car elle est rattachée à des localités connues et à une époque déterminée.
Elle me semble même assez claire pour qu'on puisse y voir une tradition,
qui aurait à sa base un fait historique. Set est un dieu bien connu dans
l'histoire d'Égypte; c'est le dieu des ennemis, et particulièrement des populations
sémitiques, qui conquirent une fois le pays et le mirent souvent en
danger. Si nous considérons qu'il est chassé par Horus, le dieu qui lui a
succédé dans la royauté, et par les habitants primitifs du pays à un moment
donné des annales divines, n'est-il pas naturel d'expliquer ce mythe par une
guerre entre les Égyptiens venus de Nubie, et les Sémites qui auraient été
chassés du pays; soit que cette guerre soit plus ancienne que les temps
historiques, soit que, venue plus tard, elle ait passé dans le domaine de
l'histoire légendaire? Les textes relatifs aux dynasties divines sont encore
trop rares pour que nous puissions pousser très-loin ces recherches. Le
temple d'Edfou nous fournira peut-être un jour de nouvelles indications sur
ces époques préhistoriques, et sur l'origine si mysterieuse de la civilisation de
l'Égypte."</p>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p391.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE WINGED SOLAR DISK.</div>
</div>

<p>In another passage Naville remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392"> 392</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Typhon n'est pas simplement le dieu du mal, l'adversaire personnel
d'Osiris, c'est un souverain qui occupe avec ses alliés la plus grande partie de
l'Égypte depuis Edfou jusqu'a l'Orient du Delta."<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was suggested (page 154) that Horus slaying Set represented
by a hippopotamus was a reference to a time antecedent
to 5000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the constellation of Draco was circumpolar;
and we now learn from Chapter XXXII. that Set represented
the Northern-Star worship brought in from the N.E.</p>

<p>Horus, then, represented a conquering force coming from
the South.</p>

<p>He was recognised as a Southern god. Naville remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Horchuti est par excellence le dieu de la Nubie; c'est à lui que sont
consacrés plusieurs des temples pharaoniques qui existent le long du Nil entre
Ouadi-Halfa et Philæ."<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But this is not all. The sequence of the Divine Dynasties
is as follows, according to Maspero:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Atmu.</li>
<li>Rā</li>
<li>Shou</li>
<li>Sibou [Seb]</li>
<li>Osiris</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Horus</li>
</ul>

<p>Neglecting the first four, we find Osiris preceding Set, and are
driven to the conclusion that in Osiris, in this connection, we
are dealing with the Moon, for the Sun-gods Atmu and Rā head
the list. Besides, the worship of Set did not kill the worship
of the <i>Sun</i>, for the power of Rā finally became paramount.</p>

<p>We must hold, then, that the Southern Sun-god Horus, the
son of Osiris, was the son of a Moon-god, and it becomes
necessary to inquire if such an idea occurred to other early
peoples. Professor Sayce<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> tells us&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393"> 393</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"According to the official religion of Chaldæa, the Sun-god was the offspring
of the Moon-god," and he adds, "Such a belief could have arisen only where the
Moon-god was the supreme object of worship.... To the Semite the Sun-god
was the lord and father of the gods."<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If we, then, with this precedent, are prepared to take Osiris
as the Moon-god of the Southern race, there is no doubt that
the first Sun-god was Chnemu, and the first Southern Star-god&mdash;the
star which heralded sunrise at the Autumnal Equinox&mdash;Khonsu
(Canopus). Thoth also must be named, for it is certain
that the Calendar which he leads was of Southern origin,
because New Year's Day at the Summer Solstice was heralded
first by Phact and afterwards by Sirius, both Southern stars.</p>

<p>There is likewise ample temple evidence to show that the
Autumnal Equinoctial Sun was also heralded, and in even
earlier times, first by Canopus and next by α Centauri, and it
becomes a question whether the original moon-calendar of
Thoth did not refer to a year beginning at the Autumnal
Equinox. This is a suggestion resulting from later inquiries,
and hence I have not referred to it in the chapters on the year.</p>

<p>And here, perhaps, in their dependence upon the Moon-god
Osiris, we find the real reason that Khonsu and Thoth
have lunar instead of solar emblems; Thoth led the initial
lunar year, Khonsu only heralded the advent of the son
of the Moon.</p>

<p>If this be so, before the foundation of the temple of Annu
by "la grande tribu des Anou,"<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> the Southern (originally Moon-worshipping)
race had already made its appearance in force in
Northern Egypt, otherwise the divine dynasties would not have
included Osiris; we need not be astonished that the temple
evidence has disappeared there. The most northern ancient
temple of Osiris was at Abydos; that also has gone, while those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394"> 394</span>
at Philæ and Edfû remain, the latter, at some time subsequent
to its original foundation, dedicated to a <i>female</i> Horus.</p>

<p>These things being presumed, we can now bring together
in a working hypothesis the temple evidence so far as it bears
upon the mythology and interaction of the North-and South-Star
worshippers.</p>

<small>THE EGYPTIAN AND BABYLONIAN ECLIPTIC CONSTELLATIONS.</small></h2></div>


<p>I have already, in Chapter XXXII., pointed out that at Annu
we seemed limited to Set as a stellar divinity; so soon as
pyramid times are reached, however, this was changed, and
we found the list of the gods increased, and the worship
of the sun and of stars in the constellations of the Bull
and Scorpion went on, if it was not begun, in Egypt, in
pyramid times. These constellations were connected with the
equinoxes; and associated with the introduction of these new
worships in pyramid times was the worship of the bull Apis.</p>

<p>The first question which now arises is, When were any
ecliptic constellations established in Babylonia? and next,
Which were they?</p>

<p>Jensen, in his "Kosmologie der Babylonier," tells us that
there is some very definite information relating not only to
Taurus and Scorpio, but to Capricornus and other winter constellations;
and, as in Egypt so in Babylonia, for the first
references to the constellations we have to refer to the religion
and the mythology.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to gather, any myth like the
Egyptian myth of Horus, involving combats between the sun
and circumpolar star gods, is entirely lacking in Babylonia,
but a similar myth in relation to some of the ecliptic constellations
is among the best known. Jensen shows that the
first notions of the Babylonian constellations are to be got
by studying the sun-gods, and especially the mythic war
between the later sun-god Marduk and the monster Tiāmat.</p>

<p>I have already referred to Marduk; he is the Spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397"> 397</span>
Sun-God, and it has also been stated that the greatest god
of ancient Babylonia, Ía of Eridu, was connected with the
constellation of Capricornus.</p>

<p>Marduk represented the constellation of the Bull. Here
I quote Jensen:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>"It has already been suggested that the Bull is a symbol
of the Spring-Sun <i>Marduk</i>; that he was originally complete;
that he at one time extended as far as the Fish of <i>Ía</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the western Fish; that the Fish of <i>Ía</i>, out of which the sun
emerged at the end of the year in ancient times to enter
Taurus, is to represent <i>Ía</i>, the God of the Ocean, out of
which his son <i>Marduk</i>, the early sun, rises daily; finally,
that a series of constellations west of the Fish(es) is intended
to represent symbolically this same ocean. <i>Marduk</i> is on the
one hand, as early sun of the day (and the year), the son
of <i>Ía</i>, the god of the world-water."</p>

<p>As to the sun-god Marduk, then, he represents the sun
at the vernal equinox, when the sunrise was heralded by
the stars in the Bull.</p>

<p>But what, then, are the fish of <i>Ía</i> and the other constellations
referred to? They are all revealed to us by the
myth. They are the Southern ecliptic constellations.</p>


<h3><i>Tiāmat.</i></h3>

<p>Tiāmat, according to Jensen, means initially the Eastern
Sea (p. 307). This was expanded to mean the "Weltwasser"
(p. 315), which may be taken to mean, I suppose, the origin
of the Greek ὠκεανὸς, and possibly the overlying firmament
of waters. These firmamental waters contain the southerly
ecliptic constellations, the winter and bad-weather signs&mdash;the
Scorpion, the Goat-fish, and the Fish among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398"> 398</span></p>

<p>It must be pointed out that these southerly constellations
were associated with the God of Eridu <i>in his first stage</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The Constellations referred to in the Myth of Marduk and
Tiāmat.</i></h4>

<p>We are indebted to the myth, then, for the knowledge
that when it was invented, not only the constellations Bull
and Scorpion, but also the Goat and Fishes had been established
in Babylonia.</p>

<p>This argument is strengthened by the following considerations
suggested by Jensen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We look in vain among the retinue of Tiāmat for an
animal corresponding to the constellations of the zodiac to
the east of the vernal equinox. This cannot be accidental.
If, therefore, we contended that the cosmogonic legends of
the Babylonians stood in close relationship to the phenomena
of sunrise on the one hand and the entrance of the sun
into the vernal equinox on the other&mdash;that, in fact, the
creation legends in general reflect these events&mdash;there could
not be a more convincing proof of our view than the fact
just mentioned. The three monsters of Tiāmat, which
<i>Marduk</i> overcomes, are located in the 'water-region' of the
heavens, which the Spring-Sun <i>Marduk</i> 'overcomes' before
entering the (ancient) Bull. If, as cannot be doubted, the
signs of the zodiac are to be regarded as symbols, and
especially if a monster like the goat-fish, whose form it
is difficult to recognise in the corresponding constellation,
can only be regarded as a symbol, then we may assume
without hesitation that at the time when the Scorpion,
the Goat-Fish, and the Fish were located as signs of
the zodiac in the water-region of the sky, they already
played their parts as the animals of Tiāmat in the creation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399"> 399</span>
legends. Of course they were not taken out of a complete
story and placed in the sky, but conceptions of a more
general kind gave the first occasion. It does not follow
that all the ancient myths now known to us must have
been available, but certainly the root-stock of them, perhaps
in the form of unsystematic and unconnected single stories
and concepts."</p>

<p>There is still further evidence for the constellation of the
Scorpion.</p>

<p>"A Scorpion-Man plays also another part in the cosmology
of the Babylonians. The Scorpion-Man and his wife guard the
gate leading to the Māšu mountain(s), and watch the sun at
rising and setting. Their upper part reaches to the sky, and
their <i>irtu</i> (breast?) to the lower regions (Epic of Gistubar 60, 9).
After Gistubar has traversed the Māšu Mountain, he reaches
the sea. This sea lies to the east or south-east. However
obscure these conceptions may be, and however they may
render a general idea impossible, one thing is clear, that the
Scorpion-Men are to be imagined at the boundary between
land and sea, upper and lower world, and in such a way that
the upper or human portion belongs to the upper region, and
the lower, the Scorpion body, to the lower. Hence the
Scorpion-Man represents the boundary between light and darkness,
between the firm land and the water region of the world.
<i>Marduk</i>, the god of light, and vanquisher of Tiāmat, <i>i.e.</i> the
ocean, has for a symbol the Bull = Taurus, into which he
entered in spring. This leads almost necessarily to the supposition
that both the Bull and the Scorpion were located in the
heavens at a time when the sun had its vernal equinox in
Taurus and its autumnal equinox in Scorpio, and that in their
principal parts or most conspicuous star groups; hence probably
in the vicinity of Aldebaran and Antares, or at an epoch when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400"> 400</span>
the principal parts of Taurus and Scorpio appeared before the
sun at the equinoxes."</p>

<p>If my suggestion be admitted that the Babylonians dealt
not with the daily fight but with the yearly fight between light
and darkness&mdash;that is, the antithesis between day and night
was expanded into the antithesis between the summer and the
winter halves of the year&mdash;then it is clear that at the vernal
equinox Scorpio setting in the west would be watching the
sunrise; at the autumnal equinox rising in the east, it would
be watching the sunset; one part would be visible in the sky,
the other would be below the horizon in the celestial waters.
If this be so, all obscurity disappears, and we have merely a
very beautiful statement of a fact, from which we learn that
the time to which the fact applied was about 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, if
the sun were then near the Pleiades.</p>

<p>Jensen, in the above-quoted passage by implication, and
in a subsequent one directly, suggests that not all the zodiacal
constellations were established at the same time. The Babylonians
apparently began with the easier problem of having
six constellations instead of twelve. For instance, we have
already found that to complete the present number, between</p>

<p class="center small">
<span class="gap6r">Scorpio</span> <span class="gap6r">Capricornus</span> Pisces
</p>

<p class="pnind">we must interpolate</p>

<p class="center small">
<span class="gap6r">Sagittarius</span>         Aquarius.
</p>

<p>Aries and Libra seem also to be late additions according to
Jensen, who writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have already above (p. 90) attempted to explain the
striking phenomenon that the Bull and Pegasus, both with half-bodies
only, ἡμίτομοι, enclose the Ram between them, by the
assumption that the latter was interposed later, when the
sun at the time of the vernal equinox was in the hind parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401"> 401</span>
of the Bull, so that this point was no longer sufficiently marked
in the sky. Another matter susceptible of a like explanation
may be noted in the region of the sky opposite to the Ram
and the Bull. Although we cannot doubt the existence of an
eastern balance, still, as already remarked (p. 68), the
Greeks have often called it χηλαὶ 'claws' (of the Scorpion),
and according to what has been said above (p. 312), the sign
for a constellation in the neighbourhood of our Libra reads in
the Arsacid inscription 'claw(s)' of the Scorpion. These facts
are very simply explained on the supposition that the Scorpion
originally extended into the region of the Balance, and that
originally α and β Libræ represented the 'horns' of the
Scorpion, but later on, when the autumnal equinox coincided
with them, the term Balance was applied to them. Although
this was used as an additional name, it was only natural that
the old term should still be used as an equivalent. But it
also indicates the great age of a portion of the zodiac."</p>

<p>Let us suppose that what happened in the case of Aries and
Libra happened with six constellations out of the twelve: <i>in
other words, that the original zodiac consisted only of six constellations</i>.</p>

<p>The left-hand list not only classifies in an unbroken manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402"> 402</span>
the Fish-Man, the Goat-Fish, the Scorpion-Man, and Marduk
of the Babylonians, but we pick up all or nearly all of the
ecliptic stars or constellations met with in early Egyptian
mythology, Apis, The Tortoise,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Min, Serk-t, Chnemu, as represented
by appropriate symbols.</p>

<p>Further, the remarkable suppression or small representation
of the Lion in both the more ancient Babylonian and
Egyptian mythology is explained. I have shown before how
the Babylonians with an equinoctial year would take slight
account of the solstice, while it also follows that the Egyptians,
who were wise enough not to use zodiacal stars for their
warnings of sunrise, for the reason that stars in the brighter
light of dawn near the sun are more difficult to see, might
easily neglect the constellation of the Lion, as first Phact and
then Sirius, both southern stars, marked for them the advent
of the summer solstice; on different grounds, then, the Lion
might well have been at first omitted in both countries.</p>

<p>Since there is a doubt as to the existence of the Lion
among the first Babylonian constellations, the argument in
the following paragraph would appear to refer to observations
made at a later time, when totemism was less prevalent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lion in the heavens must represent the heat of
the summer. He does this most effectually when the summer
solstice coincides with the constellation&mdash;that is, when its
principal stars appear before the sun at the summer solstice.
This happened at the time when the vernal equinox lay
in Taurus, and when the principal star-group of the Bull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403"> 403</span>
appeared before the sun at the time of the vernal equinox.
The Water-jug (Amphora), Aquarius, must represent symbolically
the watery season of winter. It does this most effectually
when the winter solstice coincides with it, or its
principal star-group appears before the sun at the winter
solstice. This happened about the time when the vernal
equinox lay in Taurus, and its principal star-group rose
before the sun at the time of the vernal equinox."</p>

<p>Thanks to Jensen's researches, then, we have the important
conclusion before us that the Babylonians, as well
as the Egyptians, in early times symbolised the following
constellations:&mdash;</p>

<p>But what time was this?</p>

<p>We have seen that in Egypt the Bull constellation had
been established possibly in the time of Mena, and that
certainly both the Bull and the Scorpion had been established
in pyramid times.</p>

<p>I have also given evidence to show that the E. and W.
pyramid worship was brought from Babylonia. Now, about
this date we know that Sargon I. was king of that country,
and reigned at Accad or Agade, lat. 33° N., on the right
bank of the Euphrates, Sippara being across the river. Here
it may be mentioned that the latitudes of Eridu and Babylon
are 31° N. and 32½° N. respectively, so that Agade was to
the north of both.</p>

<p>Although the worship of Marduk&mdash;that is, the vernal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404"> 404</span>
equinox Sun-god&mdash;in Babylon was much intensified when
Khammurabi reigned about 2200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it is known that it
existed long before; how long I cannot find. It is also very
remarkable that the deities of Eridu, whenever that city was
pre-eminent, were guarded by sacred bulls. We must leave
it undetermined, therefore, at what date the Bull sun-god
was established; but it seems certain, on the above grounds,
that it must have been before pyramid times.</p>

<p>But we are not limited to the above line of evidence.
There are astronomical considerations which will help us.
For the purpose of noting the validity of the argument
based upon them, a slight reference is necessary to the
change of the equinoctial point along the ecliptic.</p>

<p>By the processional movement, the position of the sun
in the ecliptic at an equinox or solstice sweeps round the
ecliptic in about 25,000 years. Now if we suppose twelve
ecliptic constellations of equal size&mdash;that is, 30° long (30° ×
12 = 360°)&mdash;the time it would take the sun's place at the
vernal equinox to pass through one constellation would be
(25000∕12 =) 2083 years. If the constellation of the Bull were twice
as long formerly as it is now (when the constellations are
twice as numerous), of course this period would be doubled.</p>

<p>So that the statement that the sun at the equinox was
in the Bull does not help us very much to an actual date,
and the constellation of the Lion could have been established
2000 years after the Bull, and yet have marked the summer
solstice.</p>

<p>Further, if all the stars of the Bull (speaking generally)
are seen at dawn&mdash;that is, before the sun rises&mdash;the sun has
not yet reached the Bull. We can then, at all events, fix a
minimum of time. The sun's longitude at the vernal equinox
being always 0, the longitude of the most easterly part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405"> 405</span>
the constellation, assuming this part not to have been changed,
will give us the number of years that have elapsed.</p>

<p>I now go on to state Jensen's view as to the date of the
introduction of the god Marduk into Babylonian mythology,
or, in other words, of the worship of the spring-tide sun.</p>

<p>Jensen remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may safely be assumed that the constellations of the
Scorpion and the Bull actually originated at the latest at a
time when the autumnal and vernal equinoctial points respectively
coincided with their principal stars. But this was
the case more than 4900 years ago. But if we assume that
Taurus and Scorpio were given their names at a time when
their main stars rose before the sun at the time of the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes respectively, we should obtain
as the date of the establishment of the constellations of
Taurus and Scorpio in the skies about the year-5000.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
According to Dr. Tetens, the sun stood at the tips of the
horns of the Bull at the commencement of spring 6000 years
ago. At this time, therefore, Taurus had completely risen
above the eastern horizon at sunrise.</p>

<p>"Since it is not inconceivable that in the delineation of
the first signs of the zodiac a name was attached to a constellation
of the ecliptic emerging from behind the sun, and
apparently more or less connected, the name being such as
to indicate symbolically the beginning of the spring then
occurring, the time, about 1400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, might also be that of
the introduction of the Bull (and the Scorpion). But it is,
of course, not necessary that this should have occurred at
one of the three epochs mentioned; this is, indeed, highly
improbable, and the process must be regarded as follows:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406"> 406</span>
When the idea was conceived of indicating symbolically the
beginning of spring in the sky&mdash;whether the idea originated
in the brains of the masses or in that of a learned scholar,
whether it had a mythological or a more scientific basis&mdash;a
name was given in the first instance to the region in
which the sun was at the beginning of spring, or to that
west of it, the name denoting symbolically the beginning of
spring. This, of course, does not exclude the possibility that
more eastward portions of the ecliptic, whose stars were less
prominent, were included in this name. From this we may
conclude that Taurus did not originate later than-3000, for
at that time Aldebaran, its principal star, stood east of the
sun at the beginning of spring. Hence it would follow
that our creation legends are, at least in part, just as old."<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>It may, then, be gathered from the above that the constellations
of the Bull and the Scorpion were recognised as
such at the same early date both in Babylonia and Egypt;
and to these we may add the Tortoise (our present Cancer)
and some of the southern constellations. Further, that the
date of their establishment was certainly not later than, say,
4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and probably much earlier.</p>

<p>With regard to the complete ecliptic, the information
seems meagre both from Babylonia and from Egypt in early
times. I have already referred to the Egyptian decans, that
is, the lists of stars rising at intervals of ten days. The lists
will be found in Lepsius and in Brugsch's "Astronomische und<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407"> 407</span>
Astrologische Inschriften," but the stars have not been made
out. In later times in Babylonia&mdash;say 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;the following
list represents the results of Jensen's investigations:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>(1) Perhaps Aries (= "leading sheep").</li>

<li>(2) A "Bull (of the Heavens)" = Aldebaran or (and) = our Taurus.</li>

<li>(3) Gemini.</li>

<li>(4)?</li>

<li>(5) Perhaps Leo.</li>

<li>(6) The constellation of the "Corn in Ears" = the Ear of Corn. [Spica.]</li>

<li>(7) Probably Libra, whose stars are, however, at least in general,
called "The Claw(s)" (<i>i.e.</i>, of the Scorpion).</li>

<li>(8) The Scorpion.</li>

<li>(9) Perhaps Sagittarius.</li>

<li>(10) The "Goat-fish" = Caper.</li>

<li>(11)?</li>

<li>(12) The "Fish" with the "Fish band."</li>
</ul>


<p>A few hundred years later, we learn from the works of
Strassmeyer and Epping, a complete chain of twenty-eight
stars along the ecliptic had been established, and most careful
observations made of the paths of the moon and planets, and
of all attendant phenomena. The ecliptic stars then used in
Babylonia were as follows:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408"> 408</span></p>

<p>In Egypt, dating from the twentieth dynasty (1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
is a series of star tables which have puzzled Egyptologists
from Champollion and Biot downwards. These observations
are recorded in several manuscripts found in tombs; they
seem to have been given as a sort of charm to the people
who were buried, in order to enable them to get through the
difficulties of the way in the nether world.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphs state that a particular star of a particular
Egyptian constellation is seen at a particular hour of the night.
We have twelve lines representing the twelve hours of the
night, and it is stated that we have in these vertical lines the
equivalent of the lines in our transit instruments, and that
the reference "in the middle," "over the right eye," "over
the right shoulder," or "over the left ear," as the case may be,
is simply a reference to the position of the star.</p>

<p>Were this confirmed, one of the remarkable things about
the inquiry would be that the Egyptians did not hesitate in
those days to make a constellation cover very nearly 90° of
right ascension, showing that they wished to have as few
constellations, including as many stars, as possible. But the
best authorities all agree that these are tables of stars rising
at different hours of the night, and a small constellation near
the pole might have taken many hours to rise.</p>

<p>The observations were made on the 1st and 16th of
every month. The chief stars seem to be twenty-four in
number, and it looked at first as if we had really here a list
of priceless value of twenty-four either ecliptic or equatorial
stars, similar to the decans to which reference has already
been made.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the list has resisted all efforts to
completely understand it. Whether it is a list of risings or
meridian passages even is still in dispute. Quite recently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409"> 409</span>
indeed, one of the investigators, Herr Gustav Bilfinger,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> has
not hesitated to consider it not a list of observations at all,
but a compilation for a special purpose.</p>

<p>"The star-table is intended to carry the principle of time
into the rigid world of the grave, and represents over the
sepulchral vault 'the eternal horizon,' as the ancient Egyptians
so aptly styled the grave, an imitation of the sky, a compensation
for the sky of the upper world with its time-measuring
motion; yet the idea here is bolder, the execution is more
artificial and complicated, since the sculptor endeavoured to
combine the daily and the annual motion of the celestial vault
in <i>one</i> picture; wanted to transfer into the grave the temporal
frames in which all human life is enacted. This endeavour to
represent by one configuration both motions and both chronological
units explains all the peculiarities and imperfections
of our star-table.</p>

<p>"The simplest means of representing both motions was
found in the stars, which circle the earth in the course of a
day, and indicate the year by the successive appearance of
new stars in the morning twilight. If the same stars were to
serve both purposes in one representation, it was necessary to
take twenty-four stars which rose at intervals of fifteen days,
since only such followed each other at an average distance of
15°, and were therefore useful for showing the hours.</p>

<p>"If the calendar-maker really possessed a list of the
twenty-four principal (zodiacal) stars, the course of the year
was indicated thereby; but since he also wanted to represent
the daily motion, he might with some justice have composed
each night out of eleven of these stars, since the stars' risings
are only visible during the ten middle hours of the night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410"> 410</span>
But ten hours would not have adequately represented the
night, since this was thought of as a twelve hours' interval.</p>

<p>"There was a way out of it&mdash;viz., to call hora 0 'sunset,'
hora 12 'sunrise,' which would have been a simple and correct
solution if the division of the night into twelve parts for
practical purposes had been aimed at. But this expedient he
could not adopt, because he could or would only operate with
stars, and the notions of sunrise and sunset found no place
in his tables. Thus he was forced to <i>falsify</i> the customary
division of the hours, by squeezing the twelve hours of the
night into the time during which star risings are visible&mdash;viz.,
the dark night exclusive of twilight. On the other hand, he
could not, with his principal stars at intervals of 15°, divide
his night, shortened as it was by two hours, into twelve parts,
and thus he was obliged to make use of two or three auxiliary
stars, as we have proved in detail above, and thus yet more
to disfigure the hour-division, since thereby the lengths of
the hours were made very variable. These are then two
things which we must not regard as peculiarities of ancient
Egyptian reckoning, but as a consequence of the leading idea
of our table, which did not intend to facilitate the division
of the night into twelve parts by star observations, but was
calculated, by the connection of thirteen stars with thirteen
successive moments, to create the idea of the circling host of
stars and thence the course of the night."</p>

<p>I give an abstract of the list of the twenty-four principal
stars and the Egyptian constellations in which they occur:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be seen that even this Egyptian star-list is very
indeterminate. It is known that Sahu is the name for the
constellation of Orion. The hippopotamus represents Draco,
and probably Necht another northern constellation. There
are indications, too, that Mena may symbolise Spica, with
which star we have seen Min-worship associated. Further
than this the authorities do not venture at present to go.</p>

<small>THE INFLUENCE OF EGYPT UPON TEMPLE-ORIENTATION IN GREECE.</small></h2></div>


<p>In the final pages of this book I have to show that recent
investigations have put beyond all doubt the fact that the
astronomical observations and temple-worship of the Egyptians
formed the basis first of Greek and later of Latin temple-building.</p>

<p>I have indicated in a former chapter that in our own days,
and in our own land, the idea of orientation which I have
endeavoured to work out for Egypt still holds its own. It
was more than probable, therefore, that we should find the
intermediate stages in those countries whither by universal
consent Egyptian ideas percolated. Among these, Greece
holds the first place, as it was the nearest point of Europe
to the Nile Valley.</p>

<p>Before we study the orientation of the Greek temples,
let us endeavour to realise the conditions of those Greek
colonists who, filled with the Egyptian learning; impressed
with the massive and glorious temples in which they had
worshipped; favoured, perchance, moreover, with glimpses of
the esoteric ideas of the priesthood; and finally, fired with
Greek ideals of the beautiful, determined that their new land
should not remain altarless.</p>

<p>What would they do? They would naturally adapt the
Egyptian temple to the new surroundings, climatic among
others. The open courts and flat roofs of Egyptian temples
would give way to covered courts and sloping roofs to deal
with a more copious rainfall; and it is curious to note that
the chief architectural differences have this simple origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413"> 413</span>
The small financial resources of a colony would be reason good
enough for a cella not far from the entrance, with courts
surrounding it under the now necessary roof. The instinctive
love of beauty would do the rest, and make it a <i>sine quâ non</i>
that the rosy-fingered dawn should be observable, and that the
coloured light of the rising sun in the more boreal clime should
render glorious a stately statue of the divinity.</p>

  <div class="caption">A GREEK TEMPLE RESTORED&mdash;THE TEMPLE OF POSEIDON AT PÆSTUM.</div>
</div>

<p>It is well to take this opportunity of emphasising the
transition from the Egyptian form of temple to the Greek
one, in order to show how completely among many apparent
changes the astronomical conditions were retained. The
entrance door and the cella are always in the axis of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414"> 414</span>
temple; the number of columns in the front is always even;
<i>the door is never blocked</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p414" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption">THE TEMPLE OF THESEUS AT ATHENS: THE ACROPOLIS, WITH THE PARTHENON, IN
THE BACKGROUND.</div>
</div>

<p>I have already pointed out that in both groups of Egyptian
temples, whether furnished with a pylon or not, one goes from
the entrance to the other end, which held the sanctuary,
through various halls of different styles of architecture and
different stages of magnificence. But in the Greek temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415"> 415</span>
this is entirely changed; the approach to the temple was
outside&mdash;witness the glorious propylæum of the Parthenon at
Athens&mdash;the temple representing, so to speak, only the core,
the Holy of Holies, of the Egyptian temple; and any magnificent
approach to it which could be given was given from
the outside. Be it further remarked that the propylæum
was never in the fair-way of the light entering the temple.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p415.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE EAST FRONT OF THE PARTHENON, FACING THE RISING OF THE PLEIADES.</div>
</div>

<p>The massive pylons of some of the Egyptian temples were
useful for shading the roofless outer courts. In Greece these
were no longer useful.</p>

<p>The east front of the Parthenon very much more resembles
the temple of Denderah than it does the early Egyptian
temple&mdash;that is to say, the eastern front is open; it is not
closed by pylons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416"> 416</span></p>

<p>The view as to the possibility of temple-orientation being
dominated by astronomical ideas first struck me at Athens and
Eleusis, and when I found that the same idea had been held
by Nissen, and that the validity of it seemed to be beyond
all question, I consulted my friend Mr. F. C. Penrose
specially with regard to Greece, as I knew he had made a
special study of some of the temples, and that, he being an
astronomer as well as an archæologist (for, alas! they are
not, as I think they should be, convertible terms), it was
possible that his observations with regard to them included
the requisite data.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to find that he had already
determined the orientation of the Parthenon with sufficient
accuracy to enable him to agree in my conclusion that
that temple had been directed to the rising of the Pleiades.
He has subsequently taken up the whole subject with
regard to Greece in a most admirable and complete way,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
and has communicated papers to the Society of Antiquaries
(February 18, 1892), and more recently to the Royal Society
(April 27, 1893) on his results.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>These results are so numerous and complete that it is
now quite possible to trace the transition from Egyptian
to Greek temple-worship, and this, with Mr. Penrose's full
permission, I propose to do in this chapter.</p>

<p>But, in the first instance, I am anxious to state that
Mr. Penrose was soon convinced that in Greece, as in
Egypt, the stars were used for heralding sunrise. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417"> 417</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The object the ancients had in using the stars was to employ their
rising and setting as a clock to give warning of the sunrise, so that on the
special feast days the priests should have timely notice for preparing the
sacrifice or ceremonial, whatever it may have been:</p>

<p>
"'Spectans orientia solis<br />
Lumina <i>rite</i> cavis undam de flumine palmis<br />
Sustulit,' etc."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I may further give an extract from a letter received
from him in which he deals with the demonstration of
the orientation hypothesis furnished by the Greek temples
alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In my paper sent to the Royal Society there was a passage which
seems to make it practically <i>certain</i> that heliacal stars were connected with
the intra-solstitial temples as derived from Greek sources alone, independent
of the powerful aid of the Egyptian cases.</p>

<p>"'That the first beam of sunrise should fall upon the statue centrally
placed in the adytum of a temple or on the incense altar in front of it on
a particular day, it would be requisite that the orientation of the temple should
coincide with the amplitude of the sun as it rose above the visible horizon,
be it mountain or plain.</p>

<p>"'That a star should act as time-warner it was necessary that it should
have so nearly the same amplitude as the sun that it could be seen from the
adytum through the eastern door, if it was to give warning at its rising, or
to have a similar but reversed amplitude towards the west, if its heliacal setting
was to be observed; and it follows that in the choice of the festival day and
the corresponding orientation, on these principles, both the amplitude of the
sun at its rising and that of the star eastwards or westwards, as the case
might be, would have to be considered in connection with one another.</p>

<p>"'From what has been said it is obvious that in the intra-solstitial temples
the list of available bright stars and constellations is in the first instance
limited to those which lie within a few degrees of the ecliptic, and it will
be found that in the list above given and those which follow, if we omit
Eleusis, where the conditions were exceptional, all but one of the stars are
found in the zodiacal constellations. A very great limit is imposed, in the
second place, by one of the conditions being the heliacal rising or setting
of those stars from which the selection has to be made. So that, when both
these combined limitations are taken into account, it becomes improbable
to the greatest degree that in every instance of intra-solstitial temples of early
foundation of which I have accurate particulars, being twenty-eight in number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418"> 418</span>
and varying in their orientation from 21° N. to 18° 25′ S. of the true east,
there should be found a bright heliacal star or constellation in the right
position at dates not in themselves improbable unless the temples had been
so oriented as to secure this combination.'</p>

<p>"I have just been looking into the number of possible stars which could
have been used, <i>i.e.</i> within the limits of the greatest distance from the
ecliptic that could have been utilised.</p>

<p>"The stars which could have been utilised in addition to the seven which
serve for nearly thirty temples are ten only, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Aldebaran.</li>
<li>Pollux.</li>
<li>β Arietis.</li>
<li>β Tauri.</li>
<li>α and β Capricorni as a group.</li>
<li>β Libræ.</li>
<li>α Libræ.</li>
<li>α Leonis.</li>
<li>γ Leonis.</li>
<li>β Leonis.</li>
</ul>

<p>"If the orientations had been placed at random, would not our thirty
temples have made many misses in aiming at these seventeen stars, it being
necessary also to hit exactly the heliacal margin? And would they have
secured anything like a due archæological sequence?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Another point is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whenever a star less than first magnitude is used (Pleiades only excepted)
it has been necessary, to secure coincidence, to give it several more degrees
of sun depression than in the cases of Spica and Antares."</p>
</div>

<p>The problem in Greece was slightly different from that in
Egypt. We had not such a great antiquity almost without
records to deal with, and moreover the feast-calendars of the
various temples presented less difficulty. There was no vague
year to contend with, and in some cases the actual dates of
building were known within a very few years.</p>

<p>In Greece, not dominated by the rise of the Nile, we should
not expect the year to begin at a solstice, but rather at the
vernal equinox. I have shown that even in pyramid times
in Egypt the risings of the Pleiades and Antares were watched
to herald the equinoctial sun; it is not surprising, therefore,
to find the earliest temples in Greece to be so oriented. Mr.
Penrose has found the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the sun at the spring equinox had left Taurus and
entered Aries, owing to precession, in Egypt the equinoxes
were no longer in question, since the solstitial year was
thoroughly established, and consequently we find no temples
to the new warning star α Arietis.</p>

<p>In Greece, however, where the vernal equinox had now
been established as the beginning of the year, we find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420"> 420</span>

this enables us to note a certain change of thought brought
about in all probability by the artistic spirit of the Greeks. The
Egyptian temples were all dark, often with a statue of a god or
a reptile obscure in the naos, and many were oriented so that
sunlight never entered them. Mr. Penrose points out that
almost all the Greek temples are oriented so that sunlight can
enter them. Of such temples we have the following twenty-nine:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now in all these Greek temples, instead of the dark naos of
the Egyptian building, we find the cella fully illumined and
facing the entrance. Frequently, too, there was a chryselephantine
statue to be rendered glorious by the coloured
morning sunlight falling upon it, or, if any temple had the
westerly aspect, by the sunset glow.</p>

<p>It was perhaps this, combined eventually with the much
later invention of water-clocks for telling the hours of the
night, which led to the non-building of temples resembling
those at Thebes and Denderah facing nearly north; of these,
however, there are scattered examples; one of very remarkable
importance, as it is a temple oriented to γ Draconis 1130 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
built therefore not very long after the temple M at Karnak,
and this temple is at Bœotian Thebes! A better proof of the
influence exerted by the Egyptians over the temple-building in
Greece could scarcely be imagined. As Mr. Penrose remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422"> 422</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thebes was called the City of the Dragon, and tradition records that
Cadmus introduced both Phœnician and Egyptian worship."</p>
</div>

<p>It would be very surprising, if we assume, as we are bound
to do, that these temples to stars were built under Egyptian
influence, that Sirius should not be represented among them,
that being the paramount star in Egypt at a time when we
should expect to find her influence most important in Greece.
Still, I have shown already that, as the Greek year ignored the
solstice, the use of Sirius as a warning star for all purposes
of utility would not come in. Mr. Penrose finds, however,
that, in spite of this, Sirius was used for temple-worship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Leaving the solar temples, we find that the star which was observed at
the great temple of Ceres must have been Sirius, not used, however, heliacally&mdash;although
this temple is not extra-solstitial&mdash;but for its own refulgence at
midnight. The date so determined is quite consistent with the probable time
of the foundation of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and the time of the year when
at its rising it would have crossed the axis at midnight agrees exactly with
that of the celebration of the Great Mysteries."</p>

<p>"It is reasonable to suppose that when, as in the case of Sirius at Eleusis,
brilliant stars were observed at night, the effect was enhanced by the priests
by means of polished surfaces."</p>
</div>

<p>Another question. Does the star follow the cult in Greece
as it does in Egypt?</p>

<p>In Greece we find the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The star α Arietis is the brightest star of the <i>first sign of the Zodiac</i>, and
would therefore be peculiarly appropriate to the temple of Jupiter. The
heliacal rising of this star agrees both with the Olympieium at Athens and
that at Olympia. There is a considerable difference in the deviation of the
axes of these two temples from the true east; but this is exactly accounted for
by the greater apparent altitude of Hymettus over the more distant mountain
at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423"> 423</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Pleiades are common to the following temples of Minerva&mdash;viz., the
Archaic temple on the Acropolis, the Hecatompedon, and Sunium. In the
two former it is the rising, the latter the setting star.</p>

<p>"There must have been something in common between the temples at
Corinth, Ægina, and Nemea. The two last, at any rate, are reputed temples
of Jupiter."</p>
</div>

<p>The Greek side of the inquiry becomes more interesting
when the connection between the orientation of the intra-solstitial
temples and the local festivals is inquired into; in
Egypt this is all but impossible at present.</p>

<p>A temple oriented to either solstice can only be associated
with the longest or with the shortest day; if the temple points
to the sunrise or sunset at any other period of the year, the
sunlight will enter the temple twice, whether it points to the
sunrise or sunset place.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Penrose finds that in Greece, as in Egypt, the
initial orientation of each intra-solstitial temple was to a star,
and this would, of course, secure observations of the star and
the holding of an associated festival at the same time of the
year for a long period. But when the precessional movement
carried the star away, they would only have the sun to depend
on, and this they might use twice a year. It is possible, as
Mr. Penrose remarks, that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"there would have been no reason for preferring one of these solar coincidences
to the other, and the feast could have been shifted to a different date if it
had been thought more convenient."</p>
</div>

<p>He goes on to add:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It would appear that something of this sort may have taken place at
Athens, for we find on the Acropolis the archaic temple, which seems to have
been intended originally for a vernal festival, offering its axis to the autumnal
sunrise on the very day of the great Panathenaia in August.</p>

<p>"The chryselephantine statue of the Parthenon, which temple followed on
the same lines as the earlier Hecatompedon (originally founded to follow the
rising of the Pleiades after that constellation had deserted the archaic temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424"> 424</span>
alongside), was lighted up by the sunrise on the feast to the same goddess in
August, the Synæcia, instead of some spring festival, for which both these
temples seem at first to have been founded.</p>

<p>"The temple at Sunium, already quoted for its October star-heralded festival
to Minerva, was oriented also axially to the sun on February 21, the feast of
the Lesser Mysteries."</p>
</div>

<p>I have had to insist again and again that in the case of
the Egyptian temples the stated date of foundation of a temple
is almost always long after that in which its lines were laid
down in accordance with the ritual. No wonder, then, that
the same thing is noticed in Greece.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In about two-thirds of the cases which I have investigated the dates deduced
from the orientations are clearly earlier than the architectural remains
now visible above the ground. This is explained by the temples having been
rebuilt upon old foundations, as may be seen in several cases which have been
excavated, of which the archaic temple of Minerva on the Acropolis of Athens
and the temple of Jupiter of Olympius on a lower site are instances. There
are temples also of the middle epoch, such as the examples at Corinth, Ægina,
and the later temples at Argos and at Olympia (the Metroum at the last-named),
of which the orientation dates are not inconsistent with what may be
gathered from other sources."</p>
</div>

<p>The problem is, moreover, helped in Greece by architectural
considerations, which are frequently lacking in Egypt:
of two temples it can be shown, on this evidence alone, that
one is older than the other. Such an appeal strengthens my
suggestion that two of the temples of the Acropolis Hill were
oriented to the Pleiades, by showing the older temple to point
to an earlier position of the star group. To these Mr. Penrose
adds another pair at Rhanmus, where he has found that there
are two temples almost touching one another, both following
(and with accordant dates) the shifting places of Spica, and
still another pair at Tegea.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> My lectures, given in November, 1890, were printed in <i>Nature</i>, April-July, 1891, under
the title "On some Points in the Early History of Astronomy," with the following note:&mdash;"From
shorthand notes of a course of lectures to working men delivered at the Museum
of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, in November, 1890. The notes were revised by me
at Aswân during the month of January. I have found, since my return from Egypt in
March, that part of the subject-matter of the lectures had been previously discussed by
Professor Nissen, who has employed the same materials as myself. To him, therefore, so far
as I at present know, belongs the credit of having first made the suggestion that ancient
temples were oriented on an astronomical basis. His articles are to be found in the <i>Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie</i>, 1885."</p>

that those who come to make oblations and offer sacrifices may face the east.... When
temples are built in the neighbourhood of a river, they should command a view of its banks,
like the temples of Egypt upon the borders of the Nile."&mdash;<i>Vitruvius, Civil Architecture,

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Since I left Egypt, in February, 1893, Captain Lyons has been good enough to comply
with my request to repeat the observations. I give the following extract from his letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mounds are only within a degree, as it is only the general direction which can
be taken.</p>

<p>
South mound old temenos wall, 289½° mag. bearing = 19½° N. of W.<br />
Wall at right angles              189° mag. bearing = 71° S. of W.<br />
</p>

<p>Going to the West mound there are two higher humps with an opening between them,
tons of limestone chips, sandstone blocks with Rameses II.'s name; so that I take this for
the site of the great pylon. It is exactly opposite the obelisk, and distant, I should guess,
600 yards.</p>

<p>
Site of S. pylon to obelisk, 106½° mag. bearing = 16½° S. of E.<br />
Pole of N. pylon to obelisk, 109½° mag. bearing = 19½° S. of E.<br />
</p>

<p>So I think probably the remaining obelisk is the northern one (<i>cf.</i> Horner, "Phil. Trans.,"
MDCCCLV., pp. 124 and 131), and the temple axis was directed 289½° mag. bearing with
corr. 5½° = 284° = 14° N. of West true amplitude."</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Amenenemāt I., the founder of the sanctuary of the sun, entreats, after he has begun the
great work (which was not finished till the time of his son, Usertesen), "May it not perish by
the vicissitudes of time, may that which is made endure!" This desire of a great king which
has come down to us through the leathern roll now preserved at Berlin, has not been
fulfilled; for of his magnificent structure, built for all eternity, nothing remains but the
obelisk we have seen, and a few blocks of stone scarcely worth mentioning. The Persian
Cambyses is unjustly accused of having destroyed the temple and city of the sun, for the city
was minutely described in detail long after his time, and the temple was still flourishing;
nay, many remains of the sanctuary, that have now long since vanished, were described even
by Arab authors.&mdash;Ebers, "Egypt," p. 190.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> On this point I gather the following information from the article "Orientation" in
the "Grand Dictionnaire Universel du 19 Siècle," by M. Pierre Larousse:&mdash;"From the fifth
century to the time of the Renaissance, the orientation of churches was generally carried out.
The mystical reasons furnished by the sacred writers&mdash;according to St. John of Damascus
and Cassiodorus&mdash;were that Jesus on the Cross had His face turned towards the West, hence
Christians during prayer must turn to the East to see it. Further, in the sacred writings
Jesus is called the East (<i>Oriens ex alto</i>). Again, Christians hope to see Christ descending in
the East on the last day. Finally, the faithful when turning to the East during prayer
establish a difference between themselves and the Jews and heretics, for the Jews when
praying turn West, and certain heretics South, and others North, hence the heathen said
they were sun-worshippers." In the ninth century there was a strong protest against
orientation. Catholic churches were built any way, and it was said, "<i>Nunc oremus ad omnem
partem quia Deus ubique est</i>."</p>

a letter I received from him:&mdash;"Tous les temples ptolémaïques et la plus grande partie
des temples pharaoniques sont des <i>reconstructions</i>. Ce que vous avez observé de Dendérah,
est vrai d'Esnéh, d'Ombos, d'Assouan, de Philæ, etc. Or, si les premiers constructeurs
d'un temple&mdash;ou chez nous d'une église&mdash;peuvent choisir presque à leur gré l'emplacement,
et par suite l'orientation, la plus convenable, il en est bien rarement de même des <i>reconstructeurs</i>.
Les maisons accumulées autour du temple les gênaient, d'ailleurs les habitudes
du culte et de la population étaient prises; on rebâtissait le temple&mdash;comme d'ordinaire
chez nous on rebâtit l'église&mdash;sur la même orientation et sur les mêmes fondations. J'ai
constaté le fait à Kom-Ombo, où les débris du temple décoré par Amenhotpou I. et
Thoutmosis III. sont orientés exactement comme ceux du temple ptolémaïque actuel, bâti
sur les ruines du précédent. Vous avez donc le droit de dire, non seulement pour Dendérah,
mais pour beaucoup d'autres temples, qu'ils ont été reconstruits sur l'orientation
du temple qu'ils remplaçaient, quand même cette orientation ne répondait plus à la
réalité des choses."</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="label">[76]</a> It should be observed that a distinction is made between the Julian and the historical
year. This comes from the fact that when astronomical phenomena are calculated for dates
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it must be remembered that chronologists are in the habit of designating by 1, or rather
by-1, the first year which precedes the instant of time at which the chronological year
commenced, while astronomers mark this year in their tables by 0. It follows, therefore,
that the rank of any year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is always marked by an additional unit in the chronological
dates. For the Christian era, of course, chronologists and astronomers work in the same way.
The following table, given by Biot, exhibits the connection between these two methods. In
the latter Biot shows the leap-years marked B, and the corresponding years in the Scaligerian
chronological period are also given.</p>

Royal Gardens, Kew, agrees in this view. He permits me to print the following extract
from a letter written to me:&mdash;"The only positive fact that I can deal with is the
representation in the pictures of a small scrubby tree, which seems to have been about
four feet high. It appears to have yielded a gummy or resinous exudation from its
trunk. Mariette supposes this to be myrrh. Pount to be Somali-land, and To Nuter
the Socotran Archipelago. All this fits in very well with botanical facts. Myrrh-producing
plants exist both in Somali-land and Arabia, and also in Socotra, as
ascertained by Bayley Balfour. The two former places still are, as they always have
been, the place of origin of myrrh, and we know that it was largely used by the
Egyptians in embalming. There is no evidence that myrrh, or anything in any way
resembling it, was ever found south of the Equator. I cannot carry you further south

of the Zambezi, of a house built on high poles. The people there live in such houses.
There is a ladder by which they mount, and all their belongings are kept above. Such
houses I have since seen at the mouth of the River Rufiji, opposite the island of Monfia, to
the south of Zanzibar. The reason in both cases for such a type of house is that the
country at one time is flooded, and also to avoid mosquitoes. Similar structures are
used, I am told, in Madagascar. At Lake Nyassa I believe there are village communities
living in the lake, on artificial islands of piles."</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_154" href="#FNanchor_154" class="label">[154]</a> One gets the idea, from reading Professor Sayce's work, that there might have

Sun and Moon worship were established at Eridu; and that the addition of Ía to the
Bīl-Anu-worship to make one triad, and the addition of Bīl to the Ía-Asari-worship
to make another, were both compromises. See Sayce, pp. 320, 347, 400.</p>

Merodach was originally a local god of Babylon, and that he was identified with the son of Ea
when a colony came to Babylon or founded that city, bringing with it the culture and theology
of the south. In this way the sun-god of Babylon became confounded with the sun-god of
Eridu. I should add that Assyriologists are not all agreed about the transitions to which I

<p><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="label">[156]</a> I owe to the kindness of Sir Arnold Kemball, K.C.B., the perusal of a valuable report
on the agriculture of British East Africa, prepared for him by Mr. W. W. A. Fitz-Gerald.
He has permitted me to print the following abstract:&mdash;"The whole of the eastern coast is
affected in a greater or lesser degree by the S.W. and N.E. monsoons. The following notes
deal only with the extent of coast-land lying opposite and to the north of Zanzibar and Pemba
islands. The agricultural seasons on the coast-lands are two in number, and correspond with
the advent of the N.E. and S.W. monsoons respectively. They are distinguished locally
as the 'greater rains,' or 'Masika M'Ku;' the 'lesser rains,' or 'Masika M'dogo.' The
greater rains inaugurate the most important cultivating season, commencing in March with
the S.W. monsoon. Some years the sowing commences as early as the 7th, but generally
speaking the average period may be given as beginning from the middle of the month, and by
the first week in April all sowings of Indian corn, rice and 'mfmah' (Millet or Sorghum
vulgare), the chief and staple food-stuffs of the people, are generally finished, though sowings
may continue till the end of April. The heaviest fall of rain occurs in April and May, and
the rain continues with gradually diminishing force to September. <i>Harvest</i> takes place in
July and August, and once the grain is off the field the land is immediately cleared and
prepared for sowing, in anticipation of the coming of the 'lesser rains' in <i>October</i>. The
season of the lesser rains is chiefly the time for the cultivation of Gingelly oil seed, beans,
and such other lesser food-stuffs. The season of the 'lesser rains' is deemed more uncertain
and less to be depended upon, and the rainfall is decidedly very much smaller in comparison.
The 'lesser rains' practically end in November, for though the wind continues steadily from
the N.N.E., the rainfall in December, January, and February is slight and uncertain, and it is
during these three months, especially the two last, that the greatest heat prevails. The
influence of the monsoons is considerably less than on Zanzibar Island, and the difference of
rainfall may be put down as about 20 to 30 inches."</p>

'favourite of Sīn,' the moon-god. And if we bear in mind that the zodiac with its
signs plays into the Babylonian legends of creation, and that the Hebrew cosmogonic
legends are derived from these, it is for us even more remarkable that the Jews place
the creation of the world 5649 years ago, however much the figures derived from the
Bible, according to other computations and traditions, may depart therefrom. Whether
this is accidental or not, I do not profess to judge."</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> With regard to a temple of Minerva using α Arietis at Tegea, Mr. Penrose writes:&mdash;"Minerva
is allowed by the poets to have been able to use Jupiter's thunder, so this is no
misappropriation of the star. Juno also seems to have claimed the use of α Arietis as at
Samos, and at Girgenti it suits the orientation of the temple of Juno better than Spica. But
Spica seems to have been connected with the worship of Juno and Diana in their more strictly
female capacity."</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
